## [Unreleased]

Post-v1.1.0 commits on `master`. No version bump yet.

### Added
- **P6b — Cron scheduler rewrite (`c670ef1`, 2026-04-17):** `sync_schedule` (5-field cron, croniter Apache 2.0) replaces drift-prone `schedule_minutes` interval. `schedule_enabled` boolean toggle preserves the expression on pause. Scheduler trigger logic corrected to `croniter.get_next(datetime) <= now` in UTC (original `get_prev() > anchor` inverted logic would never fire). Cron validation via Pydantic `@field_validator` at API boundary rejects invalid expressions with 422 and rejects adversarial patterns (e.g. `*/1 0 * * *`) via rolling 7-day sampling (2016 ticks) with a 5-minute floor. Wizard Step 3 adds 8 schedule presets + Manual + "Schedule enabled" toggle; GET `/datasources/` computes `next_sync_at` at response time. Migration 015 adds `schedule_enabled` (default true), a `chk_sync_schedule_nonempty` constraint, 8 P7 stub columns (`consecutive_failure_count`, `last_error_message`, `last_error_at`, `sync_paused`, `sync_paused_at`, `sync_paused_reason`, `retry_batch_size`, `retry_time_limit_seconds`), and converts legacy `schedule_minutes` via a 13-entry allowlist (5→`*/5 * * * *` through 1440→`0 2 * * *`); non-allowlist values are nulled and recorded in `_migration_015_report`. 395/397 tests passing (+13 new). D-SCHED-5 three-state card display deferred to P7.
- **P6a — Idempotency contract split (`e462c7e`, 2026-04-16):** Dedup contract split by connector type. Binary connectors (UPLOAD, DIRECTORY) continue to dedup by `(source_id, file_hash)`. Structured connectors (REST_API, ODBC) now dedup by `(source_id, source_path)` — file_hash becomes a change detector rather than identity. Canonical JSON serialization (`sort_keys=True`, UTF-8, newline-separated) is applied at serialization time so field-order rotation no longer causes false "new document" inserts. `POST /datasources/test-connection` performs a double-fetch 500ms apart and warns on hash mismatch with differing key list — envelope pollution surfaces at config time, not three weeks post-GA. `ingest_structured_record` wraps the compare-hash / update path in `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` so two concurrent workers can't race to produce non-deterministic chunk counts. On content UPDATE, old Chunk rows and pgvector embeddings are atomically DELETE-then-re-generate in the same transaction — no stale search results. `documents.connector_type` + `updated_at` columns added; partial UNIQUE indexes `uq_documents_binary_hash` (binary) and `uq_documents_structured_path` (structured). Migration 014 includes dedup DELETE of pre-existing duplicates by `MAX(ingested_at)`. 382+19 tests passing.
- `RestApiConnector`: generic REST connector supporting API key, Bearer, OAuth2 (client credentials), and Basic auth. Configurable pagination (page/offset/cursor/none), response formats (JSON/XML/CSV), max_records cap, 50MB per-fetch size guard, and `since_field` incremental sync.
- `OdbcConnector`: tabular data source connector via pyodbc. Row-as-document (JSON), SQL injection guard on all identifier fields, DSN component error scrubbing, 10MB per-row size guard, incremental sync via `modified_column`.
- `connectors/retry.py`: shared HTTP retry utility — exponential backoff with ±20% jitter, Retry-After header support, 30s ceiling, per-request 30s timeout. Test-connection path bypasses retry for fast admin feedback.
- Migration 013: adds `last_sync_cursor` column and `rest_api`/`odbc` to `source_type` enum.
- `POST /datasources/test-connection` extended for `rest_api` and `odbc` source types (10s timeout, credential scrubbing).
- Frontend wizard: Step 2 now branches on `rest_api` and `odbc` source types with full config forms and credential masking.
- **Deadline notifications (§17 priority 3):** Celery beat now fires `request_deadline_approaching` (requests due within 3 days) and `request_deadline_overdue` (past-deadline requests) notifications daily. Core logic in `backend/app/requests/deadline_check.py`; beat tasks wired in `backend/app/ingestion/scheduler.py`. Recipient is the assigned staff user; requests with no `assigned_to` are skipped. Deduplication prevents re-firing within 23 hours. Templates were already seeded (§8.4). 9 new tests (278→287).
- **Focus visibility (Session A of accessibility audit):** Global `:focus-visible` outline fallback in `frontend/src/globals.css @layer base` targeting `a`, `[role="link"]`, and `[tabindex]:not([tabindex="-1"]):not([data-slot])`. Uses 2px outline in brand `--ring` (#1F5A84) with 2px offset. Excludes `[data-slot]` so it does not double-stack with the Tailwind `focus-visible:ring-3 focus-visible:ring-ring/50` that shadcn Button, Input, and SelectTrigger already ship. Closes spec §13 "Focus visibility" requirement; spec §17 priority #1 sub-item 1a.
- **`request_received` notification dispatch:** `create_request` now calls `queue_notification("request_received", ...)` when `requester_email` is present. Pattern mirrors `update_request`'s PATCH-dynamic dispatch. Closes the last router-side gap in the §8.3 dispatch matrix. Two new regression tests in `test_notification_dispatch.py` (positive + negative), passing fail-before / pass-after sanity check. Test suite 274 → 276.

### Fixed
- **Geist Variable font actually wired:** `frontend/src/main.tsx` now imports `@fontsource-variable/geist`, so Vite bundles and serves the font (three woff2 variants). Previously it was listed as a dependency but never imported — the rendered font was falling back to the system sans stack. `frontend/src/globals.css` body `font-family` and `frontend/tailwind.config.js` `fontFamily.sans` both updated from "Inter" to "Geist Variable". The v1.0.0 entry below (which had claimed "Inter typography scale") is also corrected to "Geist Variable typography scale" since that was always the intent.
- **Mark Fulfilled button 404 (from the April 13/14 session):** `RequestDetail.tsx` was posting to `POST /requests/{id}/sent`, a route that does not exist. Changed the action from `"sent"` to `"fulfilled"` and extended `handleAction` to route `"fulfilled"` through PATCH alongside `"searching"`. Removed the `sent` display alias from `status-badge.tsx`.
- **Legacy `RequestStatus.SENT` enum value removed:** Migration `010_remove_sent_status.py` performs a defensive UPDATE → drop column default → rename-recreate dance → restore default → drop old enum type. `VALID_TRANSITIONS`, `/stats` active filters, and analytics `closed_statuses` all updated. 11 statuses → 10. Downgrade is intentional no-op (matches migration 008's pattern).
- **Schema drift repaired:** Migration `011_fix_schema_drift.py` adds three columns that existed in SQLAlchemy models but were missing from Alembic migrations — `notification_log.subject` (VARCHAR 500 nullable), `notification_log.body` (TEXT nullable), `exemption_rules.version` (INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1). Integration tests had been masking the drift by using `create_all()` instead of walking migrations.
- **Session B.1 accessibility fixes — F2 + F1:**
  - **F2 resolved (WCAG 2.1.1):** `data-table.tsx` TableRow now has `tabIndex={0}`, `role="button"`, and `onKeyDown` handling Enter/Space (with `e.preventDefault()`). Keyboard-only staff can now open records requests from the Requests list. Post-fix verification: `focusVisible: true` on focused `<tr role="button">`, Enter and Space both navigated to `/requests/<uuid>`. Sequenced first because this was a functional blocker on the core workflow — highest user-visible severity in the entire audit.
  - **F1 resolved (WCAG 1.4.11):** `ring-3` → `ring-[3px]` on `button.tsx:7`, `input.tsx:12`, `select.tsx:44`. The Tailwind v4 `ring-3` utility was silently missing (v3 alias removed); the arbitrary-value replacement emits correctly. Post-rebuild computed-style verification: `--tw-ring-shadow` = `0 0 0 calc(3px + 0px) hsl(207 62% 32% / .5)`, `box-shadow` = `rgba(31, 87, 132, 0.5) 0px 0px 0px 3px` on keyboard-focused Button (Dashboard), Input (Onboarding "City Name"), and SelectTrigger (Requests filter bar). `focusVisible: true` on all three.
- **Session B.2/C accessibility fixes — F3–F6 (this commit):**
  - **F3 resolved (no code change):** DOM inspection confirmed base-ui v1.3.0 already sets `tabindex="-1"` on its hidden form input. Requests filter bar: 4 tab stops for 4 visible controls (was 10 for 6). No upstream fix or CSS selector needed.
  - **F4 resolved (WCAG 1.3.1):** `aria-label` added to all 15 SelectTriggers across 5 pages — `Exemptions.tsx` (1: "Exemption category"), `Onboarding.tsx` (5: "State", "Population band", "Email platform", "Dedicated IT department", "Monthly records request volume"), `Requests.tsx` (4: "Status filter", "Department filter", "Priority filter", "Assigned to filter"), `Search.tsx` (2: "File type filter", "Department filter"), `Users.tsx` (3: "User role" ×2, "Department"). All 4 Requests filter triggers show non-null `aria-label` attributes in DOM.
  - **F5 resolved (partial):** Created `frontend/src/components/loading-region.tsx` — `<div aria-live="polite" aria-busy={loading}>` wrapper. Applied to DataTable in Requests, AuditLog, Users, Exemptions; to results block in Search. `role="status"` + `aria-label` added to early-return loading `<div>` in Dashboard ("Loading dashboard data") and DataSources ("Loading data sources"). Remaining pages (RequestDetail, Ingestion, CityProfile, Onboarding) carry forward to Session C.
  - **F6 resolved:** Added polymorphic `as?: React.ElementType` prop to `CardTitle` in `frontend/src/components/ui/card.tsx` (defaults to `"div"`; note: `@radix-ui/react-slot` not installed — project uses base-ui). Applied `as="h2"` to 7 sections in `RequestDetail.tsx`: Request Details, Attached Documents, Timeline, Messages, Fees, Response Letter, Workflow. `<h1>=1, <h2>=7` post-edit.
  - **`<tr role="button">` SR proxy:** Row has `role="button"`, `tabIndex=0`. Cell content is in child `<td>` elements with standard table semantics — accessible name computed from cell text by AT row-traversal. Enter and Space key activation verified in Session B.1.
  - **Dialog focus trap:** Verified on Exemptions new-exemption modal. `focusInsideDialog=true` on open; Tab cycles within dialog. Escape is a pre-existing controlled-dialog behavior (`showForm` state managed by `Exemptions.tsx`); not introduced by our changes.
  - **Form error handling (1d) — NOT MET:** Login "Login failed" error is `<p class="text-destructive">` with no `role="alert"`, no `aria-live`, no `aria-describedby`. Visual-only — screen readers will not announce it. Flagged for Session C.
- **Liaison scoping (§17 priority 2):** LIAISON-role users can now access department-scoped Requests and Search. Backend: `require_role` minimum lowered from STAFF to LIAISON on `GET /requests/`, `GET /requests/stats`, `GET /requests/{id}`, and `POST /search/query`; `execute_search` injects `department_id` into search filters automatically for all non-admin users with a department (audit log integrity preserved — `SearchQuery` stores original `req.filters`); Alembic migration 012 adds LIAISON and PUBLIC enum values; search engine dept filter corrected to `d.department_id` on documents table (276→278 tests). Frontend: `App.tsx` fetches `/api/users/me` for role; `SidebarNav` hides Users, Audit Log, and Onboarding items for LIAISON; `LiaisonGuard` redirects direct navigation to hidden routes.
- **Session C accessibility fixes — form error ARIA + F5 completion + Search live region:**
  - **Form error ARIA (1d) resolved (WCAG 4.1.3):** `role="alert"` added to every form-error container across 8 locations in 6 pages — `Login.tsx` (1: page-level error `<div>`), `Users.tsx` (3: create-dialog formError, page-level error, edit-dialog editError), `Exemptions.tsx` (1: page-level error `<Card>`), `DataSources.tsx` (1: page-level error `<Card>`), `Onboarding.tsx` (1: submit error `<p>`), `Requests.tsx` (1: page-level error `<Card>`). `role="alert"` carries implicit `aria-live="assertive"` + `aria-atomic="true"` — screen readers announce the error immediately when it mounts. `setError("")` / `setFormError("")` called before each submit ensures the container unmounts/remounts on each error, guaranteeing re-announcement. Commits: `226453c` (Login), `98791d6` (Users), `47b92a3` (Exemptions, DataSources, Onboarding, Requests).
  - **F5 completed (WCAG 4.1.3):** `role="status"` + `aria-label` added to the early-return loading skeleton `<div>` in `RequestDetail.tsx` ("Loading request details"), `Ingestion.tsx` ("Loading ingestion dashboard"), and `CityProfile.tsx` ("Loading city profile"). Completes F5 across all 7 affected pages (Dashboard and DataSources were done in B.2/C). Commit: `b8d60ae`.
  - **Search `aria-live` restructured:** Replaced the `LoadingRegion` wrapper (which was placed inside the `{results && !loading}` conditional — `aria-busy` was always `false` when mounted) with a persistent `<div aria-live="polite" aria-busy={loading} aria-label="Search results">` gated on `(loading || hasSearched)`. `aria-busy` now correctly transitions `true → false` when results arrive, triggering screen-reader announcement. Removed unused `LoadingRegion` import. TypeScript build: EXIT:0. Commit: `bdfc230`.

### Changed
- **Canonical spec imported at v3.1:** `docs/UNIFIED-SPEC.md` replaced with the v3.1 repo-verified canonical (was v2.0). Source `.docx` preserved at `docs/CivicRecordsAI-UnifiedSpec-v3.1.docx`. Eleven corrections applied during import: §8.3 rewritten with the audited notification dispatch matrix; status count "11 statuses" → "10 statuses" in 4 places; §6.6 `notification_log` and §6.7 `exemption_rules` column lists corrected; §17 priority #5 marked DONE inline; §14 documentation suite row updated; Appendix B footer updated. See commit `1b4795d`.
- **Spec post-Session A hotfix:** §1 test suite line and §2 summary line now read 276 tests. §7.2 typography note rewritten to explain the pre-`2663836` mis-wire and current state. §13 accessibility table focus-visibility row marked Met (post-v1.1.0 in `2663836`) with the full selector and token explanation — **this claim is corrected below by Session B**. §15 release history adds an `_unreleased_` row for post-v1.1.0 work. §16 capability summary test row updated to 276; a11y audit row split into "focus visibility implemented" vs. "keyboard nav / form errors / screen reader audit pending." §17 priorities restructured: accessibility audit broken into sub-items (1a done, 1b–1d pending); deadline notifications promoted to item 3; CHANGELOG font correction marked done.
- **CLAUDE.md context-mode section:** Rewritten from a short "Context Mode (MANDATORY)" note into the full 4-Stage Context-Mode Protocol (GATHER → FOLLOW-UP → PROCESS → WRITE), with forbidden/allowed Bash verb lists, a refusal template, the `context-mode-gate.sh` PreToolUse hook reference, and the `"override hard rule 10"` bypass phrase. Commit `2685f00`. Process/tooling only, no code.
- **Session B accessibility audit — 14-page keyboard navigation walk.** Four pages walked live via Chrome MCP with injected JS reading computed styles after a real Tab keystroke (Login, Dashboard, Requests, RequestDetail); ten pages audited via static source read (Search, Exemptions, DataSources, Ingestion, Users, Onboarding, CityProfile, Discovery, Settings, AuditLog). Findings dropped into spec §13.2 (requirements summary), §13.3 (per-page scoring table), §13.4 (F1–F7 details), and §13.5 (remediation sequencing). Seven findings:
  - **F1 — Tailwind v4 `ring-3` utility silently missing** on every shadcn primitive (Button, Input, SelectTrigger). The v3 alias was removed in Tailwind v4; the CSS bundle contains zero rules matching `.focus-visible\:ring-3:focus-visible`, and computed `--tw-ring-shadow` is `0 0 #0000` on a genuinely keyboard-focused primitive. Only `focus-visible:border-ring` renders, producing a 1px border color swap that likely fails WCAG 2.2 AA 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast.
  - **F2 — `data-table.tsx` row onClick without keyboard handler** — WCAG 2.1.1 hard fail on the Requests page. A keyboard-only staff member cannot open a records request from the list. Blast radius is one page (sole `onRowClick` consumer) but the bug is in the shared component. Most user-visible accessibility bug in the audit.
  - **F3 — base-ui Select hidden form-input leaks into tab order** (every page using `<Select>`; live-confirmed on Requests filter bar which registers 10 tab stops for 6 visible controls).
  - **F4 — SelectTrigger missing `aria-label`** on all Requests filter dropdowns; inferred system-wide.
  - **F5 — data-loading pages lack `aria-live` / `aria-busy` regions** (every page with async data; confirmed live on Dashboard and Requests).
  - **F6 — RequestDetail heading hierarchy is flat** (`<h1>=1, <h2>=0` for a 5-section page).
  - **F7 — non-WCAG observation:** sidebar nav order buries Dashboard 9th.
- **Self-correction to the Session A `Added` entry above.** The "Focus visibility (Session A of accessibility audit)" bullet claimed the shadcn primitives ship a 3px focus ring. That claim is accurate at the **CSS class-presence level** but **not at the render level** — Session B's live walkthrough proved the `ring-3` utility is silently absent from the compiled CSS. The global `:focus-visible` outline fallback added to `globals.css` still renders correctly on bare `<a>`, `[role="link"]`, and non-primitive `[tabindex]` elements (that part of the Session A entry is accurate). **What is wrong is the shadcn primitive half of the claim.** Spec §13 focus-visibility row has been corrected from Met to Partial. Phase 1 hotfix commit `b6627db` made the original misstatement based on class-presence inspection, not computed-style verification — that error is owned and documented here on the permanent record. Remediation is queued as **Session B.1 = F2 + F1** (F2 first because its severity is orders of magnitude higher).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- **Department Scoping:** Department model with CRUD API, department assignment on users and data sources, department-based access control on requests
- **50-State Exemption Rules:** 180 exemption rules across 51 jurisdictions (50 states + DC), seeded from canonical state public records law database
- **Compliance Templates:** 5 seeded compliance documents (AI use disclosure, response letter disclosure, CAIA impact assessment, AI governance policy, data residency attestation)
- **Model Registry:** Admin-managed Ollama model registry with context window tracking, active model selection, and automatic budget scaling in context manager
- **Central LLM Client:** All LLM generation calls route through `app/llm/client.py` — enforces context manager budgeting, prompt injection sanitization, and model-registry context window scaling on every call. Refactored exemptions reviewer, search synthesizer, and ingestion extractor to use it
- **Notification System:** 12 notification templates aligned with all router-dispatched event types, city_name sourced from city profile for email templates, queue_notification wired into 5 status transitions
- **Users Edit/Deactivate:** PATCH /admin/users/{id} endpoint with self-demotion lockout and self-deactivation guard. Frontend edit dialog and deactivate button with confirmation
- **Search Department Filter:** Department filtering on both semantic and keyword search engines via document-source-department join chain. Department dropdown in search UI
- **Search CSV Export:** GET /search/export endpoint with authenticated download. Export button in search results
- **Fee Estimation:** POST /requests/{id}/estimate-fees — staff enters page count, system calculates from fee schedule rates
- **Fee Waivers:** FeeWaiver model with Alembic migration, create/approve/deny workflow, automatic fee_status update on approval. Waiver types: indigency, public interest, media, government, other
- **Exemption Audit History:** GET /exemptions/rules/{id}/history returns audit log entries for any rule. Timeline UI in Exemptions page
- **Exemption Rule Test Modal:** POST /exemptions/rules/{id}/test — tests regex or keyword rules against sample text with match positions. ReDoS protection via `regex` library with 2-second timeout. LLM-type rules rejected with 400
- **Sources 3-Step Wizard:** Replaced single-step add dialog with guided wizard (source type selection, connection config per type, review + test connection). POST /datasources/test-connection validates connectivity without persisting credentials
- **Dashboard Coverage Gaps:** GET /admin/coverage-gaps identifies jurisdictions without exemption rules, departments without assigned staff, and exemption categories without active rules. Warning card on dashboard when gaps > 0
- **Search Citation Rendering:** AI summary panel renders [Doc: filename, Page: N] citations as styled inline badges instead of plain text
- **Request Priority Indicators:** Priority column with colored badges (urgent/expedited/normal/low) on Requests table
- **Ingestion Retry:** POST /datasources/documents/{id}/re-ingest retries failed documents (resets to pending, queues Celery task). Progress indicator for processing items, auto-refresh while active
- **Rich Text Editor:** TipTap editor replaces plain textarea for response letter editing. Toolbar with bold, italic, underline, bullet list, ordered list. Content stored as HTML in edited_content field
- **Onboarding LLM Interview:** POST /onboarding/interview generates adaptive setup questions based on incomplete city profile fields. Chat-style UI with skip button, profile updates via PATCH /city-profile. Falls back to default questions when LLM unavailable
- **DOCX/XLSX Macro Stripping:** Parsers strip VBA macros at ZIP level before text extraction. Supports .docm and .xlsm. Stripping logged in metadata for audit
- **WCAG 44x44px Touch Targets:** min-width: 44px added alongside min-height for all interactive elements. All icon button variants enforce minimum touch target

### Changed
- **Department Names on Users Page:** UUID column replaced with human-readable department names via /departments/ API lookup
- **Legacy .xls Blocklisted:** Removed .xls from XlsxParser supported extensions — BIFF8 binary format cannot be macro-stripped with ZIP approach
- **Dead CSS Selector Removed:** `a.nav-link` in globals.css was unreachable (WCAG 44px applied via Tailwind inline on sidebar NavLinks)
- **Version Alignment:** config.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, and CHANGELOG all at 1.1.0

### Fixed
- **Notification Event-Type Mismatch:** Aligned 12 seed templates with router dispatch strings — all 5 dispatch paths now deliver notifications instead of silently no-oping on 3 of 5
- **Notification Seed Production Run:** Confirmed execution against production DB (5 created, 7 skipped)
- **Audit Log CSV Export:** Frontend export button now uses authenticated fetch with ?format=csv and blob download instead of bare anchor tag (was returning 401)
- **Dockerfile:** Added compliance_templates/, scripts/, and tests/ to COPY directives — compliance template test was failing on clean builds
- **city_name in Notifications:** All 5 queue_notification call sites now include city_name from CityProfile — 8 templates were silently failing at render time due to missing template variable
- **GitHub Pages Build:** Added .nojekyll to docs/ — Jekyll was failing on spec markdown files, causing 59 consecutive failed pages-build-deployment runs

### Security
- **ReDoS Protection:** Exemption rule test endpoint uses `regex` library with timeout=2s for admin-entered patterns — prevents catastrophic backtracking
- **Test-Connection Credential Safety:** POST /datasources/test-connection uses dedicated schema, never persists credentials, never logs connection strings, never returns credentials in response
- **Self-Demotion Guard:** Admins cannot change their own role or deactivate their own account via the PATCH endpoint
- **Macro Stripping:** VBA macros stripped from DOCX/XLSX before ingestion — defense-in-depth for document pipeline security

### Tests
- 274 automated tests (up from 80 in v0.1.0, 104 at v1.0.0 release)
- +36 tests in debt sprint: LLM client wiring (3), user management (7), search features (3), fee lifecycle (5), exemption features (6), datasource connection (4), coverage gaps (2), ingestion retry (2), onboarding interview (4)
- Template render mismatch test catches any notification template referencing variables not provided by the router
- Seed coverage test ensures every router-dispatched event_type has a matching template
- .xls blocklist test prevents accidental re-addition of legacy format
