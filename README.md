# CivicRecords AI

**Open-source, locally-hosted AI that helps American cities respond to open records requests.**

CivicRecords AI runs entirely on a single machine inside your city's network — no cloud subscriptions, no vendor lock-in, no resident data leaving the building. It ingests your city's documents, makes them searchable with AI-powered natural language queries, detects potential exemptions, and manages the full request lifecycle from intake to response.

## Why This Exists

Every city in America processes open records requests (FOIA, CORA, and state equivalents). Staff manually search file shares, email archives, and databases — then review every document for exemptions before release. It's slow, error-prone, and a growing burden as request volumes increase.

No open-source tool exists for the **responder side** of open records at the municipal level. CivicRecords AI fills that gap.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Search** — Natural language hybrid search (semantic + keyword) across all ingested city documents with source attribution, normalized relevance scores, and optional AI-generated summaries
- **Document Ingestion** — Automatic parsing of PDF, DOCX, XLSX, CSV, email, HTML, and text files. Scanned documents processed via multimodal AI (Gemma 4) with Tesseract OCR fallback
- **Exemption Detection** — Tier 1 PII detection (SSN, credit card with Luhn validation, phone, email, bank accounts, state-specific driver's licenses) plus per-state statutory keyword matching. Optional LLM secondary review. All flags require human confirmation
- **Request Management** — Full lifecycle tracking with 11 statuses: intake, clarification, assignment, search, review, drafting, approval, fulfillment, closure. Timeline, messaging, fee tracking, and response letter generation
- **Guided Onboarding** — 3-phase wizard helps cities configure their profile, identify data systems across 12 municipal domains, and surface coverage gaps
- **Municipal Systems Catalog** — Curated knowledge base of 25+ municipal software vendors across 12 functional domains (finance, public safety, permitting, HR, etc.) with discovery hints and connector templates
- **Universal Connector Framework** — Standardized protocol (authenticate/discover/fetch/health_check) for connecting to city data sources. File system connector built; SMTP/IMAP email and manual export drop connectors planned for MVP. SQL databases, SMB/NFS, SharePoint, and REST API connectors planned for v1.1+
- **Operational Analytics** — Real-time metrics: average response time, deadline compliance rate, overdue requests, status breakdown
- **Notification Service** — Template-based notification system for request lifecycle events (template CRUD and queue built; SMTP email delivery not yet implemented)
- **Compliance by Design** — Hash-chained audit logs, human-in-the-loop enforcement, AI content labeling, data sovereignty verification. Designed for Colorado CAIA and 50-state regulatory compliance. CJIS compliance gate for public safety connectors
- **Civic Design System** — Professional UI built with shadcn/ui, civic blue design tokens, sidebar navigation. WCAG 2.2 AA targeted (44px touch targets, skip navigation, icon+color status badges — accessibility audit pending)
- **Federation-Ready** — REST API with service accounts enables future cross-jurisdiction record discovery between CivicRecords AI instances

### Install

**Windows:**
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/scottconverse/civicrecords-ai.git
cd civicrecords-ai
.\install.ps1
```

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/scottconverse/civicrecords-ai.git
cd civicrecords-ai

### First Use

1. Open **http://localhost:8080** in your browser
2. Sign in with the admin credentials you configured in `.env`
3. Go to **Sources** → **Add Source** → enter a directory path to your documents
4. Click **Ingest Now** — documents are parsed, chunked, and indexed automatically
5. Go to **Search** — type a natural language query and get cited results

**7 Docker services:** PostgreSQL 17 + pgvector, Redis 7.2, Ollama, FastAPI, Celery worker, Celery beat, nginx frontend.

**Tech stack:** Python 3.12, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2.0, React 18, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, Alembic, Celery, pgvector, nomic-embed-text, Gemma 4 (recommended).

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables in `.env`:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string | `postgresql+asyncpg://civicrecords:civicrecords@postgres:5432/civicrecords` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret key for JWT tokens | (must be set) |
| `FIRST_ADMIN_EMAIL` | Initial admin account email | `admin@example.gov` |
| `FIRST_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Initial admin account password | (must be set) |
| `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` | Ollama API endpoint | `http://ollama:11434` |
| `REDIS_URL` | Redis connection string | `redis://redis:6379/0` |
| `AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS` | Audit log retention period | `1095` (3 years) |

## Supported Platforms

- Windows 10/11 (Docker Desktop)
- macOS 13+ (Docker Desktop)
- Ubuntu 22.04+ / Debian 12+ (Docker Engine)

All platforms use identical Docker containers — the application runs in Linux containers regardless of host OS.

## Data Sovereignty

CivicRecords AI is designed for environments where resident data must never leave the network:

- Runs entirely on local hardware — no cloud dependencies
- No telemetry, analytics, or crash reporting
- All LLM inference runs locally via Ollama
- Verification script confirms no outbound connections: `bash scripts/verify-sovereignty.sh`
