# CivicRecords AI

**Open-source, locally-hosted AI that helps American cities respond to open records requests.**

CivicRecords AI runs entirely on a single machine inside your city's network — no cloud subscriptions, no vendor lock-in, no resident data leaving the building. It ingests your city's documents, makes them searchable with AI-powered natural language queries, detects potential exemptions, and manages the full request lifecycle from intake to response.

## Why This Exists

Every city in America processes open records requests (FOIA, CORA, and state equivalents). Staff manually search file shares, email archives, and databases — then review every document for exemptions before release. It's slow, error-prone, and a growing burden as request volumes increase.

No open-source tool exists for the **responder side** of open records at the municipal level. CivicRecords AI fills that gap.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Search** — Natural language hybrid search (semantic + keyword) across all ingested city documents with source attribution, normalized relevance scores, and optional AI-generated summaries
- **Document Ingestion** — Automatic parsing of PDF, DOCX, XLSX, CSV, email, HTML, and text files. Scanned documents processed via multimodal AI (Gemma 4) with Tesseract OCR fallback
- **Exemption Detection** — Tier 1 PII detection (SSN, credit card with Luhn validation, phone, email, bank accounts, state-specific driver's licenses) plus per-state statutory keyword matching. Optional LLM secondary review. All flags require human confirmation
- **Request Management** — Full lifecycle tracking with 10 statuses: received, clarification needed, assigned, searching, in review, ready for release, drafted, approved, fulfilled, closed. Timeline, messaging, fee tracking, and response letter generation
- **Guided Onboarding** — 3-phase wizard helps cities configure their profile, identify data systems across 12 municipal domains, and surface coverage gaps
- **Municipal Systems Catalog** — Curated knowledge base of 25+ municipal software vendors across 12 functional domains (finance, public safety, permitting, HR, etc.) with discovery hints and connector templates
- **Universal Connector Framework** — Standardized protocol (authenticate/discover/fetch/health_check) for connecting to city data sources. Ships with four implemented connector types: `file_system` (local/mounted directories), `manual_drop` (watched drop folders), `rest_api` (generic REST API — API key / Bearer / OAuth2 client-credentials / Basic auth; JSON/XML/CSV; page/offset/cursor pagination), and `odbc` (SQL databases via pyodbc, row-as-document with SQL-injection guards). IMAP email, SMB/NFS, and SharePoint connectors on roadmap
- **Scheduled Sync & Idempotent Ingestion** — Per-source cron scheduling (5-field expressions via croniter, evaluated in UTC with local-time disclosure, rolling 7-day min-interval validation, 5-minute floor) with `schedule_enabled` pause toggle. Idempotent pipeline: binary sources dedup by content hash, structured REST/ODBC sources dedup by stable source-path with canonical JSON serialization. Concurrent-update races prevented via `SELECT FOR UPDATE` + partial UNIQUE indexes; content updates atomically replace chunks and embeddings in the same transaction
- **Sync Failure Tracking & Circuit Breaker** — Per-record failure tracking with two-layer retry (task-level exponential backoff + record-level per-tick retry with N=100/T=90s cap). Automatic circuit breaker after 5 consecutive full-run failures (`sync_paused`) with admin-feedback unpause grace period. `health_status` (healthy/degraded/circuit_open) computed live from failure counts. Admin UI: colored health badge, failed records panel with bulk retry/dismiss, Sync Now button with real-time polling progress
- **Operational Analytics** — Real-time metrics: average response time, deadline compliance rate, overdue requests, status breakdown
- **Notification Service** — Template-based notification system with SMTP email delivery via Celery beat (60s interval). Configure SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USERNAME, SMTP_PASSWORD in .env to enable. Notification dispatch into status transitions pending
- **Compliance by Design** — Hash-chained audit logs, human-in-the-loop enforcement, AI content labeling, data sovereignty verification. Designed for Colorado CAIA and 50-state regulatory compliance. CJIS compliance gate for public safety connectors
- **Civic Design System** — Professional UI built with shadcn/ui, civic blue design tokens, sidebar navigation. WCAG 2.2 AA targeted (44px touch targets, skip navigation, icon+color status badges — accessibility audit pending)
- **Federation-Ready** — REST API with service accounts enables future cross-jurisdiction record discovery between CivicRecords AI instances

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- **Docker Desktop** (Windows 10/11, macOS 13+) or **Docker Engine** (Linux)
- **8+ CPU cores**, **32 GB RAM**, **50 GB free disk space**
- No internet connection required after initial setup

### Install

> **Current install path — script-based.** The scripts below configure and start the Docker Compose stack. They do not install Docker, WSL, or any other system prerequisites — those must already be present. A full-spectrum guided installer (with prerequisite detection, Docker/WSL setup, hardware compatibility checks, and Gemma 4 viability verification) is a planned deliverable tracked as [T5E in the remediation roadmap](docs/REMEDIATION-PLAN-2026-04-19.md).

**Windows:**
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/scottconverse/civicrecords-ai.git
cd civicrecords-ai
.\install.ps1
```

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/scottconverse/civicrecords-ai.git
cd civicrecords-ai
bash install.sh
```

### First Use

1. Open **http://localhost:8080** in your browser
2. Sign in with the admin credentials you configured in `.env`
3. Go to **Sources** → **Add Source** → enter a directory path to your documents
4. Click **Ingest Now** — documents are parsed, chunked, and indexed automatically
5. Go to **Search** — type a natural language query and get cited results

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables in `.env`:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string | `postgresql+asyncpg://civicrecords:civicrecords@postgres:5432/civicrecords` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret key for JWT tokens | (must be set) |
| `FIRST_ADMIN_EMAIL` | Initial admin account email | `admin@example.gov` |
| `FIRST_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Initial admin account password | (must be set — min 12 chars; installer generates automatically; `.env.example` placeholder and common defaults rejected at startup) |
| `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` | Ollama API endpoint | `http://ollama:11434` |
| `REDIS_URL` | Redis connection string | `redis://redis:6379/0` |
| `AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS` | Audit log retention period | `1095` (3 years) |
| `CONNECTOR_HOST_ALLOWLIST` | Comma-separated hostnames/IPs exempt from SSRF block (on-prem use) | (empty — RFC1918, loopback, and cloud IMDS ranges blocked by default) |

## Supported Platforms

- Windows 10/11 (Docker Desktop)
- macOS 13+ (Docker Desktop)
- Ubuntu 22.04+ / Debian 12+ (Docker Engine)

All platforms use identical Docker containers — the application runs in Linux containers regardless of host OS.

## Data Sovereignty

CivicRecords AI is designed for environments where resident data must never leave the network:

- Runs entirely on local hardware — no cloud dependencies
- No telemetry, analytics, or crash reporting
- All LLM inference runs locally via Ollama
- Verification script confirms no outbound connections: `bash scripts/verify-sovereignty.sh`

### Testing Prerequisites

Integration tests require Docker Compose with PostgreSQL running, and the `civicrecords` Postgres user needs DROP/CREATE DATABASE privileges (the default docker compose config does this automatically). Each test drops and recreates `civicrecords_test` to guarantee a clean schema.

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres redis
docker compose run --rm api python -m pytest tests -q
```

If a prior test run died mid-fixture, `civicrecords_test` may already exist and the suite will fail with `DuplicateDatabaseError`. Drop it manually and re-run:

```bash
docker compose exec postgres dropdb -U civicrecords civicrecords_test
```

## User Roles

## Status

**v1.1.0** — Phase 2 release with department access controls, 50-state exemption rules, and compliance templates.

**New in v1.1.0:**
- Department-level access controls — staff scoped to own department, admins see all
- Department CRUD API with audit logging
- 50-state + DC exemption rule coverage (180 rules across 51 jurisdictions)
- 5 compliance template documents (AI Use Disclosure, Response Letter Disclosure, CAIA Impact Assessment, AI Governance Policy, Data Residency Attestation)
- Template render endpoint with city profile variable substitution
- Exemption auditability dashboard with acceptance/rejection rates and CSV/JSON export (time-period filtering not yet implemented)
- Model registry CRUD endpoints (spec 6.7 compliance metadata)

**Carried from v1.0.x:**
- 13 staff workbench pages + Login with shadcn/ui design system
- 29 database tables, ~30 API endpoints
- 556 backend + 7 frontend automated tests passing (GitHub Actions CI-verified)
- Guided onboarding, systems catalog, connector framework
- Request timeline, messaging, fee tracking, response letter generation
- Operational analytics and notification service
- AMD GPU/NPU hardware auto-detection (ROCm on Linux, DirectML on Windows)
- Login rate limiting, audit log archival, admin-only user creation
- Tested on Windows 11 (Docker Desktop) and Ubuntu 22.04 (Docker Engine)

**Post-v1.1.0 security hardening (on master, not yet released):**
- **T2A** — Role self-escalation via `PATCH /users/me` closed (`UserSelfUpdate` schema); all 24 department-scoped handlers enforce `require_department_scope`; 404/403 status-code info-leak unified via `require_department_or_404`; Pattern D list-endpoint fail-open fixed on 4 routes; parameterized enforcement test covers 25 routes
- **T2B** — `connection_config` redacted from `GET /datasources/` for all non-admin users (`DataSourceAdminRead` returned only on admin write endpoints). **ENG-001 runtime exposure: closed. At-rest storage (plaintext JSONB in DB) remains open — tracked as Tier 6.**
- **T2C** — `FIRST_ADMIN_PASSWORD` startup validator (rejects `.env.example` placeholder, empty, <12 chars, and common defaults); SSRF host validator blocks loopback, IMDS, and RFC1918 ranges on REST and ODBC connector URLs at schema-validation time
- **T3A** — Create-user form now POSTs to `/api/admin/users` (was `/api/auth/register`, which silently downgraded submitted roles to STAFF)
- **CI** — 556 backend + 7 frontend tests; bootstrap-failure smoke test confirms stack rejects placeholder admin password

> **ENG-001 standing caveat:** At-rest encryption for `data_sources.connection_config` is not yet implemented. The JSONB column is visible to any database superuser, `pg_dump` output, or restored backup. ENG-001 will not be fully closed until Tier 6 at-rest encryption lands.

**Roadmap (per [canonical spec](docs/UNIFIED-SPEC.md)):**

| Phase | Focus | Key Deliverables | Status |
|-------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| **Phase 0** | Design foundation | shadcn/ui, design tokens, sidebar shell, component library | In progress |
| **Phase 1** | Staff workbench redesign | Redesign all staff pages with new design system, WCAG 2.2 AA | In progress |
| **Phase 2** | New backend features | Fees, notifications (SMTP), response letters, context manager, analytics, liaison role, department scoping, audit retention | Partially built |
| **Phase 3** | Public portal | Public homepage, search, guided request wizard, request tracker, help pages | Planned (v1.1) |
| **Phase 4** | Transparency layer | Open records library, reporting dashboards, public archive, federation | Planned (v2.0) |

*Note: Version numbers (semver) track release history. Phase numbers track design completeness per the canonical spec. They are separate systems. Current build (v1.1.0) includes backend work from Phases 0-2 but has not completed the full scope of any phase. See [canonical spec](docs/UNIFIED-SPEC.md) for complete requirements and [reconciliation](docs/RECONCILIATION-2026-04-13.md) for current gap analysis.*
