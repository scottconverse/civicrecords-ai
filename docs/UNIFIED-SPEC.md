## 1. Purpose of This Document
This is the single source of truth for CivicRecords AI. It merges comprehensive design detail with implementation status verified directly against the repository at commit head. Every feature is tagged with its actual implementation state.
When narrative claims and repository evidence disagree, repository evidence wins. This document replaces all prior spec versions.

### 1.1 Version Alignment (Resolved)
As of v1.1.0, version numbers are aligned across all four authoritative files:
backend/app/config.py: APP_VERSION = "1.1.0"
backend/pyproject.toml: version = "1.1.0"
frontend/package.json: version = "1.1.0"
CHANGELOG.md: [1.1.0] - 2026-04-13
The version drift documented in prior spec versions has been resolved. The CHANGELOG now covers three releases: 0.1.0 (foundation), 1.0.0 (design system + core features), and 1.1.0 (department scoping, compliance, and feature sprint).

## 2. Product Summary

### 2.1 What It Is
Open-source, locally-hosted AI system for municipal open records request processing. Runs on commodity hardware via Docker. No cloud, no vendor lock-in, no telemetry.

### 2.2 North-Star Statement
Any resident should be able to search for public records, request what is missing, and understand the status of their request without needing insider knowledge of city government.
Staff corollary: Any records clerk should be able to triage, search, review, redact, and respond to records requests from a single calm interface without falling back to email, spreadsheets, or paper.

### 2.3 What It Is Not
Not a records management system — it indexes and searches what already exists.
Not a legal advisor — it surfaces suggestions, staff make all decisions.
Not a cloud service — every deployment is a sovereign instance owned by the city.
Not a public-facing portal yet — internal staff tool first. Public portal is [PLANNED].

### 2.4 Design Stance & Principles
Transparent, calm, accessible, and government-appropriate. Trust through clarity, not visual excitement.
Clarity over bureaucracy — residents should not need to understand government structure.
Transparency over mystery — statuses, timelines, costs, and next actions always visible.
Consistency over one-off screens — shared patterns reduce confusion and cost.
Accessibility over compliance theater — forms must be usable, not merely valid.
Operational calm over case chaos — staff views aid triage, not add clutter.
Human-in-the-loop always — no auto-redaction, no auto-denial, no auto-release.

### 2.5 Current Product Scope
As of v1.1.0, the system implements:
Local deployment on a single-machine Docker stack (7 services)
Internal authentication with 6-role RBAC hierarchy
Department-level access controls with staff scoping
Document ingestion (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, CSV, email, HTML, text) with macro stripping
Hybrid search (semantic + keyword) with department filtering and CSV export
Request lifecycle management (10 statuses) with priority indicators
Exemption detection: 180 rules across 51 jurisdictions, Tier 1 PII detection, rule testing with ReDoS protection
Fee tracking with estimation, line items, and waiver workflows
Response letter generation with TipTap rich text editor
Notification service: 12 templates, SMTP delivery, dispatched via PATCH dynamic dispatch and 4 dedicated endpoints (see §8.3 for the audited matrix)
Operational analytics and dashboard with coverage gap indicators
Guided onboarding with LLM-powered adaptive interview
Municipal systems catalog (12 domains, 25+ vendors)
Connector framework (file system, generic REST API, ODBC via pyodbc, IMAP email, manual drop)
Central LLM client with context manager, token budgeting, and prompt injection sanitization
Compliance templates (5 documents) and model registry
Hash-chained audit logging with CSV/JSON export
556 automated backend tests + 7 frontend tests (all passing; CI-verified)
Not yet implemented: public resident portal, public search/request tracking, full active network discovery engine, cross-instance federation workflows, liaison department-scoped UI (role exists, full scoping not complete), Tier 2/3 redaction.

## 3. User Groups & RBAC

### 3.1 Staff Users

| User Group | Primary Need | Design Response |
|---|---|---|
| City clerk / records officer | Triage, route, communicate, and complete requests. | Queue views, routing rules, templates, SLA timers, full event history. |
| Department liaison | Provide documents and answer scoped questions quickly. | Scoped assignment view, internal notes, due dates, one-click return to records team. |
| Legal / reviewer | Review exemptions, redactions, and sensitive material. | Review queue, exemption tags, redaction ledger, approval state. |
| City IT administrator | Install, configure, and maintain the system. | Docker Compose, admin panel, model management, audit export. |

### 3.2 Public Users [PLANNED]

| User Group | Primary Need | Design Response |
|---|---|---|
| Resident / first-time requester | Submit a request without knowing the exact record title. | Guided request flow, plain-language examples, estimated turnaround. |
| Journalist / researcher | Search existing records and request additional material. | Robust search, saved filters, exportable results, request history. |

### 3.3 RBAC Role Hierarchy [IMPLEMENTED]
All 6 roles are defined in UserRole enum with a numeric hierarchy. Role hierarchy enforced via `require_department_scope`, `require_department_or_404`, `require_department_filter`, and role-threshold checks on endpoints. (`check_department_access` was removed in T2A-cleanup — all callers migrated to the fail-closed helpers.)

| Role | Level | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| admin | 6 | Full system access, user management, configuration, model registry | [IMPLEMENTED] |
| reviewer | 5 | Everything staff can do + approve/reject responses and exemption flags | [IMPLEMENTED] |
| staff | 4 | Request management, search, ingestion, exemption review, fee management | [IMPLEMENTED] |
| liaison | 3 | Department-scoped via check_department_access(); can view department resources but cannot create requests or manage exemptions | [IMPLEMENTED] |
| read_only | 2 | View dashboards and reports only | [IMPLEMENTED] |
| public | 1 | Submit requests, track own requests, search published records | [IMPLEMENTED — role defined, no public endpoints yet] |

Service accounts with hashed API keys (SHA-256) enable instance-to-instance federation access.

## 4. Information Architecture

### 4.1 Staff Workbench — 13 Pages + Login

| Help & Policy | Open records law summary, fee schedule, exemptions, contact | [PLANNED] |

### 4.3 Navigation Rules
Staff workbench: Sidebar navigation (240px fixed, 56px header). Grouped sections: Workflow / Setup / Administration. Active page highlighted with left border accent.
Public portal: Top navigation with no more than 6 top-level choices.
Every page identifiable from peripheral vision — unique page icon, header treatment, or accent color.

## 5. System Architecture

### 5.1 Docker Compose Stack [IMPLEMENTED]
The main docker-compose.yml defines a 7-service stack. Variant files exist for dev, GPU, and host-ollama configurations.

### 5.3 Central LLM Client [NEW in v1.1.0]
All LLM generation calls route through backend/app/llm/client.py, which enforces:
Context manager token budgeting on every call
Prompt injection sanitization
Model-registry context window scaling (reads context_window_size from model_registry table)
Refactored consumers: exemptions reviewer, search synthesizer, ingestion extractor, onboarding interview.

### 5.4 Context Manager [IMPLEMENTED]
backend/app/llm/context_manager.py implements priority-based context assembly for local LLM calls:
TokenBudget dataclass with configurable allocations: system_instruction (500), request_context (500), retrieved_chunks (5000), exemption_rules (500), output_reservation (1500), safety_margin (192)
estimate_tokens() function (~1 token per 4 chars)
assemble_context() — prioritizes system > request > top-k chunks > exemption rules within budget
ContextBlock data structure for organized prompt assembly
Model-aware budgeting: reads context_window_size from model_registry, auto-adjusts when admin switches models

## 7. Visual Design System

### 7.1 Design Tokens

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| brand.primary | #1F5A84 | Core actions, links, active navigation |
| brand.primaryDark | #163D59 | Page titles, hover states |
| brand.primaryLight | #E8F0F7 | Info backgrounds, selected states |
| text.default | #1F2933 | Body text, headings |

| status.warning | #8A5A0A | Pending, clarification needed, approaching deadline |
| status.danger | #8B2E2E | Overdue, denied, failed |

### 7.2 Typography
Note: The frontend uses Geist Variable (@fontsource-variable/geist v5.2.8), imported in `main.tsx` and wired through `globals.css` body font-family and `tailwind.config.js` fontFamily.sans. Prior to commit `2663836` the dependency was declared but never imported, so the rendered font fell back to the system sans stack; the CHANGELOG v1.0.0 entry has also been corrected from "Inter typography scale" to "Geist Variable typography scale." Typography targets below are Geist metrics.

| Element | Current | Target |
|---|---|---|
| H1 (page title) | Not used | 36px / 700 weight |
| H2 (section head) | 20px / 600 weight | 28px / 600 weight |
| H3 (subsection) | 14px / 500 weight | 22px / 600 weight |
| Body | 16px / 400 weight | 16px / 400 weight |
| Labels | 14px / mixed | 13px / 500 weight / uppercase / 0.05em |
| Stat card numbers | Mixed | 36px / 700 weight for primary metrics |

### 7.3 Status Badges
Every badge includes an icon — never color-only. StatusBadge component maps color+icon across request, document, and exemption domains.

| Status | Color Role | Icon | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| Received | info (blue) | Inbox | — |
| Clarification needed | warning (amber) | MessageCircle | — |
| Assigned | info (blue) | UserCheck | — |
| Searching | info (blue) | Search | — |
| In review | warning (amber) | Eye | — |
| Ready for release | success (green) | CheckCircle | — |
| Drafted | info (blue) | FileText | — |
| Approved | success (green) | ShieldCheck | — |
| Fulfilled | success (green) | Send | — |
| Closed | neutral (gray) | Archive | — |

### 7.4 Priority Badges [NEW in v1.1.0]

| Priority | Color | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Urgent | Red/danger badge | Legally mandated expedited processing |
| Expedited | Amber/warning badge | High-priority by policy or volume |
| Normal | Blue/info badge | Standard processing timeline |
| Low | Gray/neutral badge | Bulk or low-urgency requests |

### 7.5 Button Variants (3 only)

| Variant | Use | Style |
|---|---|---|
| Primary | Main page action (New Request, Submit for Review) | Filled brand.primary, white text |
| Secondary | Supporting actions (Search & Attach, Export) | Outlined brand.primary border, transparent bg |
| Ghost | Tertiary actions (Sign out, Cancel, Back) | Text-only, hover bg surface.subtle |

### 7.6 Reusable Components [IMPLEMENTED]
StatCard — metric display with loading, empty, and error states
PageHeader — consistent page titles
EmptyState — smart contextual guidance ("No flags reviewed yet" not "0.0%")
DataTable — sortable, filterable tables with loading states
StatusBadge — color+icon mapping across all domains

## 8. Workflow Patterns

### 8.1 Request Lifecycle [IMPLEMENTED]
10 statuses: [Received] → [Clarification Needed]? → [Assigned] → [Searching] → [In Review] → [Ready for Release] → [Drafted] → [Approved] → [Fulfilled] → [Closed]
Every status transition writes to request_timeline, writes to audit_log, triggers notification dispatch (if template exists), and updates records_requests.status.

The lifecycle has 10 statuses. The legacy `sent` value was removed in migration 010 — it was a leftover from the original v0.1.0 enum, marked in code as a "legacy alias for fulfilled" and orphaned by the broken Mark Fulfilled UX path (see section 8.3). Migration 010 collapses any historical `sent` rows into `fulfilled` and drops the enum value via the standard rename-recreate dance.
### 8.2 Response Letter Generation [IMPLEMENTED]
Clerk clicks [Generate Response Letter] on Request Detail.
Central LLM client assembles context within token budget via context manager.
LLM generates draft letter (labeled "AI-GENERATED DRAFT — REQUIRES HUMAN REVIEW").
Clerk edits in TipTap rich text editor (bold, italic, underline, bullet/ordered lists). Content stored as HTML.
Submit for Approval → Supervisor reviews → Approve → Send.

### 8.3 Notification Dispatch [IMPLEMENTED]
12 notification templates seeded. Dispatch is via the PATCH `/{request_id}` endpoint, which fires `queue_notification()` with a dynamically-built `event_type` of `request_{new_status}` for every reachable status transition. In addition, four dedicated POST endpoints (`submit_for_review`, `mark_ready_for_release`, `approve_request`, `reject_request`) call `queue_notification()` directly. `city_name` is sourced from `CityProfile` for template rendering. SMTP delivery is performed asynchronously by `smtp_delivery.py` driven by Celery beat (60s interval). Notification rows enter `notification_log` with `status='queued'` and are picked up on the next beat tick.

The Mark Fulfilled UX path was repaired in this release. The "Mark Fulfilled" button in `RequestDetail.tsx` had been pointing at `POST /requests/{id}/sent` — a route that does not exist — so every click 404'd and no notifications ever fired from that path. The button now PATCHes `status='fulfilled'`, which routes through the dynamic dispatch and produces the expected `request_fulfilled` notification. End-to-end manual verification (2026-04-14): a request walked through `searching → in_review → ready_for_release → approved → fulfilled` produces exactly five `notification_log` rows, one per transition, with rendered subjects.

#### Dispatch matrix (audited)

| Template event_type | Template seeded | Dispatch path | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `request_received` | yes | `create_request` (no call site) | OPEN — template-only; `create_request` does not yet call `queue_notification()` |
| `request_clarification_needed` | yes | PATCH dynamic | wired |
| `request_assigned` | yes | PATCH dynamic | wired |
| `request_searching` | yes | PATCH dynamic | wired |
| `request_in_review` | yes | PATCH dynamic + dedicated `submit_for_review` | wired |
| `request_ready_for_release` | yes | PATCH dynamic + dedicated `mark_ready_for_release` | wired |
| `request_drafted` | yes | PATCH dynamic + dedicated `reject_request` | wired |
| `request_approved` | yes | PATCH dynamic + dedicated `approve_request` | wired |
| `request_fulfilled` | yes | PATCH dynamic | wired (was unreachable until UI fix) |
| `request_closed` | yes | PATCH dynamic | wired |
| `request_deadline_approaching` | yes | Celery beat daily (no router call site) | IMPLEMENTED — `check_deadline_approaching()` in `deadline_check.py` |
| `request_deadline_overdue` | yes | Celery beat daily (no router call site) | IMPLEMENTED — `check_deadline_overdue()` in `deadline_check.py` |

The `sent` event type and the legacy `RequestStatus.SENT` enum value were removed in migration 010 (`010_remove_sent_status`). See section 8.1 for the lifecycle update.

#### Conceptual recipients (target design)

| Event | Recipient | Channel |
|---|---|---|
| Request received | Requester | Email |
| Clarification needed | Requester | Email |
| Request assigned | Liaison | In-app |
| Deadline approaching (3 days) | Assigned staff | In-app + Email |
| Deadline overdue | Assigned staff + Admin | In-app + Email |
| Records ready | Requester | Email |
| Request closed | Requester | Email |

### 8.4 Fee Workflow [IMPLEMENTED]
POST /requests/{id}/estimate-fees — staff enters page count, system calculates from fee schedule rates
Fee line items tracked per request with automatic total calculation
Fee waiver workflow: create waiver (indigency/public_interest/media/government/other) → approve/deny → automatic fee_status update on approval

### 8.5 Data Source Connection [NEW in v1.1.0]
3-step guided wizard replaces single-step add dialog
Step 1: Source type selection. Step 2: Connection config per type. Step 3: Review + test connection.
POST /datasources/test-connection validates connectivity without persisting credentials

### 8.6 Onboarding Interview [NEW in v1.1.0]
POST /onboarding/interview generates adaptive setup questions based on incomplete city profile fields
Chat-style UI with skip button
Profile updates via PATCH /city-profile
Falls back to default questions when LLM unavailable

## 9. Search & Ingestion [IMPLEMENTED]

### 9.1 Ingestion Pipeline
Two-track model:
Conventional parsers for structured/text-layer files (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, CSV, email, HTML, text)
Multimodal/OCR path for scanned/image-heavy material (Gemma 4 with Tesseract fallback)
[NEW] DOCX/XLSX macro stripping — VBA macros stripped at ZIP level before text extraction. Supports .docm and .xlsm. Stripping logged in metadata for audit.
[NEW] Legacy .xls blocklisted — BIFF8 binary format cannot be macro-stripped with ZIP approach
[NEW] Ingestion retry — POST /datasources/documents/{id}/re-ingest retries failed documents. Progress indicator for processing items, auto-refresh while active.
Sentence-aware text chunking with configurable overlap
Embeddings via nomic-embed-text through Ollama with batch support, stored in pgvector

### 9.2 Hybrid Search
Semantic search via pgvector embeddings
Keyword/full-text search via PostgreSQL tsvector
Combined via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)
Normalized relevance scoring (0–100 scale with visual progress bar)
Source attribution on every result
Optional AI-generated summaries (labeled as AI draft)
[NEW] Department filter — department dropdown filters via document-source-department join chain
[NEW] CSV export — GET /search/export with authenticated download
[NEW] Citation rendering — AI summary panel renders [Doc: filename, Page: N] as styled inline badges

## 10. Exemptions & Compliance

### 10.1 Exemption Rules [IMPLEMENTED]
180 rules across 51 jurisdictions (50 states + DC). Three rule types: regex, keyword, statutory.

### 10.2 Tier 1 PII Detection [IMPLEMENTED]
Built-in patterns: SSN, credit card (Luhn-validated), bank routing/account numbers, phone, email, DOB, state-specific driver's license patterns (CO, CA, TX, NY, FL).

### 10.3 Exemption Review Dashboard [IMPLEMENTED]
Acceptance/rejection rates
Export: /exemptions/dashboard/export?format=json|csv
[NEW] Rule test modal — POST /exemptions/rules/{id}/test tests regex or keyword rules against sample text with match positions. ReDoS protection via regex library with 2-second timeout. LLM-type rules rejected with 400.
[NEW] Audit history — GET /exemptions/rules/{id}/history returns audit log entries. Timeline UI in Exemptions page.

### 10.4 Tiered Redaction Engine [PLANNED]

| Tier | Method | What It Detects | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 | RegEx pattern matching | SSNs, credit cards, phone, email, bank accounts, driver's licenses | [IMPLEMENTED — in exemption engine] |
| Tier 2 | NLP/NER (Ollama or spaCy) | Person names, medical info, juvenile IDs, attorney-client privilege | [PLANNED] |
| Tier 3 | Visual AI (GPU required) | Faces/plates in video, OCR for scanned docs, speech-to-text | [PLANNED] |

### 10.5 Compliance Architecture [IMPLEMENTED]

#### Human-in-the-Loop
No auto-redaction. Every exemption flag requires affirmative human action.
No auto-denial. No auto-release. All AI content labeled at API layer.

#### Audit Logging
Hash-chained (SHA-256), append-only. Every API call logged. CSV/JSON export. Chain verification endpoint.

#### Data Sovereignty
No outbound connections (verification script: scripts/verify-sovereignty.sh)

### 11.5 Security for Connectors
Network discovery: disabled by default, explicit IT opt-in, audit-logged.
Every connection: admin must review, confirm, provide credentials, authorize.
Credentials (API): `connection_config` fields are redacted from non-admin API responses (T2B); admin write endpoints return the full config. At-rest storage is **plaintext JSONB** — visible to DB superusers, pg_dump outputs, and backups. AES-256 at-rest encryption is tracked as **ENG-001 / Tier 6** and is not yet implemented. Credentials are never logged, returned on GET, or displayed after initial admin entry.
Test-connection endpoint: dedicated schema, never persists credentials, never logs connection strings.
Least-privilege: read-only accounts. System never writes to source systems.
CJIS Compliance: Architecture satisfies encryption (5.10.1), audit logging (5.4), access control (5.5), no cloud egress (5.10.3.2). City must satisfy fingerprint checks (5.12), signed addendum, and security training (5.2). Compliance gate blocks public safety connector activation until confirmed.

## 12. Security Hardening
Security measures implemented across the stack:
JWT authentication with configurable lifetime, minimum 32-char secret enforced at startup
Login rate limiting in main.py middleware
Role-based access control with 6-role numeric hierarchy
Self-demotion guard — admins cannot change their own role or deactivate their own account
Hash-chained audit log (SHA-256) — tamper-evident, append-only
Prompt injection sanitization in central LLM client
ReDoS protection — regex library with 2s timeout for admin-entered exemption patterns
VBA macro stripping from DOCX/XLSX at ZIP level before ingestion
Legacy .xls blocklisted (BIFF8 cannot be macro-stripped)
Test-connection credential safety — never persists, logs, or returns credentials
API keys hashed (SHA-256) before storage
No telemetry, no outbound connections, no crash reporting
SMTP credentials never logged or displayed after entry
All LLM outputs labeled as AI-generated drafts
T2A — Department scope enforcement: role self-escalation via `PATCH /users/me` closed (`UserSelfUpdate` schema); all 24 department-scoped request handlers use `require_department_scope` (fail-closed); 404/403 status-code info-leak unified via `require_department_or_404` across 21 handler call sites; Pattern D list-endpoint fail-open closed on `GET /requests/`, `/requests/stats`, `POST /search/query`, `GET /search/export` via `require_department_filter`; parameterized cross-endpoint enforcement test covers 25 routes; `review_fee_waiver` gap found by auditor during review and fixed in same PR
T2B — Connection credential redaction: `connection_config` removed from `DataSourceRead`; `DataSourceAdminRead` (full config) returned only by admin write endpoints (`POST /datasources/`, `PATCH /datasources/{id}`). Runtime credential exposure to non-admin users: **closed**. At-rest storage exposure (plaintext JSONB): **open**, tracked as ENG-001 / Tier 6
T2C — Bootstrap hardening: `Settings.check_first_admin_password` model-validator rejects `.env.example` placeholder, empty value, <12 chars, and an embedded blocklist of common defaults; installers generate a 32-hex-char password and substitute it into `.env`; bootstrap-failure CI job confirms non-zero exit with placeholder
T2C — SSRF protection: `backend/app/security/host_validator.py` rejects connector URLs targeting loopback (127.0.0.0/8, ::1), link-local/IMDS (169.254.0.0/16), RFC1918 (10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16), and 0.0.0.0 at Pydantic schema-validation time; `CONNECTOR_HOST_ALLOWLIST` env var for on-prem overrides (exact-match only, no wildcards); ODBC fail-closed on unparseable host field
T3A — Admin user creation: `frontend/src/pages/Users.tsx` create-user form POSTs to `/api/admin/users` (was `/api/auth/register`, which routed through `UserCreate.force_staff_role` and silently downgraded any submitted role to STAFF); three create-form labels received `htmlFor`/`id` associations

## 13. Accessibility
Target: WCAG 2.2 AA. Session B (keyboard navigation audit) is complete as of this commit. **Session B also revealed that the Phase 1 hotfix claim in `b6627db` — that focus visibility was Met post-`2663836` — is incorrect.** The claim was based on CSS class-presence inspection, not on computed styles in a live browser. A real keyboard walk showed the intended 3px ring never renders on any shadcn primitive (see F1). Corrected below. Form error handling and full screen reader audit remain pending for Session C.

### 13.1 Scope of Session B
Session B is a keyboard navigation audit. It verified:
- Tab order, tab-stop completeness, skip-nav reachability, and `div onClick` / positive-tabindex hygiene on all 14 pages. Four pages were walked live via Chrome MCP + injected JS probes reading computed styles after a **real Tab keystroke** (Login, Dashboard, Requests, RequestDetail). The remaining ten pages were audited via static source read (Search, Exemptions, DataSources, Ingestion, Users, Onboarding, CityProfile, Discovery, Settings, AuditLog).
- Computed focus styles on **real** keyboard focus, not programmatic `el.focus()` — the latter does not trigger `:focus-visible` and would have silently passed the broken state reported in F1.

Session B did **not** verify and explicitly defers to **Session C**:
- Live screen reader announcements via NVDA or VoiceOver.
- Form error association and announcement on invalid submit (no validation states were triggered live).
- Dialog focus-trap behavior on live modals (shadcn / base-ui Dialog is structurally correct but unobserved in this audit).

### 13.2 WCAG 2.2 AA Requirements Summary

| Requirement | Current State | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Color contrast | Passes (text ~15:1, muted ~5.7:1) | Met |
| Touch targets | 44×44px enforced (min-width + min-height on all interactive elements, all icon button variants) | Met [v1.1.0] |
| Focus visibility | **Met (Session B.1).** `ring-3` → `ring-[3px]` fix shipped in this commit (see §13.4 F1). Post-rebuild computed-style verification after a real Tab keystroke: `--tw-ring-shadow` = `0 0 0 calc(3px + 0px) hsl(207 62% 32% / .5)` and `box-shadow` = `rgba(31, 87, 132, 0.5) 0px 0px 0px 3px` on keyboard-focused Button (Dashboard), Input (Onboarding "City Name"), and SelectTrigger (Requests filter bar); `focusVisible: true` on all three. The global `:focus-visible` outline fallback from `2663836` continues to render correctly on bare `<a>`, `[role="link"]`, and non-primitive `[tabindex]` elements. **Historical note:** Session B found that the Phase 1 hotfix (`b6627db`) incorrectly marked this "Met" — the 3px ring was never rendering on primitives because Tailwind v4 dropped the `ring-3` alias. Corrected to Partial in Session B, then fixed and confirmed Met in Session B.1. | Met (Session B.1) |
| Skip navigation | Skip-to-content link present and reachable as the first tab stop; verified live on Login, Dashboard, Requests, RequestDetail | Met [v1.0.0] |
| ARIA landmarks | `main`, `nav`, `header`, `h1` present on every page walked live | Met |
| Color-only indicators | StatusBadge uses icon+color across all domains | Met [v1.0.0] |
| Keyboard navigation | **Met — F2 resolved (Session B.1); F3–F6 resolved (Session B.2/C).** F2 resolved in Session B.1 — `data-table.tsx` TableRow `tabIndex={0}` + `role="button"` + `onKeyDown`; keyboard-only staff can open records requests. F3 resolved — DOM-confirmed: base-ui v1.3.0 already sets `tabindex="-1"` on its hidden form input; Requests filter bar reads 4 tab stops for 4 visible controls (was 10). F4 resolved — `aria-label` added to all 15 SelectTriggers across Exemptions, Onboarding, Requests, Search, Users. F5 resolved — `LoadingRegion` (`aria-live="polite"`, `aria-busy`) applied to Requests, AuditLog, Users, Exemptions, Search; Dashboard/DataSources early-return loading divs have `role="status"`. F6 resolved — 7 `<h2>` sections added to RequestDetail via CardTitle `as` prop. See §13.3 for per-page scoring and §13.4 for findings F2–F6. | Met — F2 resolved (B.1); F3–F6 resolved (B.2/C) |
| Form error handling | **Not tested in Session B.** No validation errors were triggered live. Source scan found 0 of 14 pages using `aria-describedby` / `aria-invalid` patterns in error UI, but the scan cannot confirm whether rendered error text is actually associated with its input. Full verification deferred to **Session C** (requires real invalid submits + screen reader listening). | Audit pending (Session C) |
| Screen reader | **Partial — F3–F6 fixes applied (Session B.2/C); full NVDA/VoiceOver audit deferred to Session C.** F3 (Select phantom inputs): DOM-confirmed already resolved in base-ui v1.3.0 — no code change needed. F4 (SelectTrigger `aria-label`): 15 instances fixed across Exemptions, Onboarding, Requests, Search, Users. F5 (`aria-live`/`aria-busy`): `LoadingRegion` component applied to Requests, AuditLog, Users, Exemptions, Search; Dashboard/DataSources early-return divs have `role="status"`. F6 (RequestDetail heading hierarchy): 7 `<h2>` sections — Request Details, Attached Documents, Timeline, Messages, Fees, Response Letter, Workflow. Form error handling (WCAG 3.3.1): Login "Login failed" error is `<p class="text-destructive">` with no `role="alert"`, no `aria-live`, no `aria-describedby` — NOT MET, flagged for Session C. Full SR verification (NVDA/VoiceOver) deferred to **Session C**. | Partial — fixes applied (B.2/C); full SR audit pending (Session C) |

### 13.3 Per-Page Audit Scorecard

"Not tested" in the form-error and screen-reader columns is deliberate — those are Session C scope and are carried forward without change. "N/A" means the page has no interactive surface of that type.

| Page | Focus visibility | Keyboard navigation | Form error handling | Screen reader |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Login | Met (F1—B.1) | Met | Partial (no `role="alert"` on error — F8, Session C) | Partial (F5 — no async data load on this page; form error SR gap documented) |
| Dashboard | Met (F1—B.1) | Met | N/A | Met (F5—B.2/C; `role="status"` on loading div) |
| Search | Met (F1—B.1) | Met (F3—B.2/C) | Not tested | Met (F4, F5—B.2/C) |
| Requests | Met (F1—B.1) | Met (F3—B.2/C) | Not tested | Met (F4, F5—B.2/C) |
| RequestDetail | Met (F1—B.1) | Partial (scrollable regions not live-verified) | Not tested | Partial (F5 — LoadingRegion not yet applied); Met (F6—B.2/C) |
| Exemptions | Met (F1—B.1) | Met (F3—B.2/C) | Not tested | Met (F4, F5—B.2/C) |
| DataSources | Met (F1—B.1) | Met | Not tested | Met (F5—B.2/C; `role="status"` on loading div) |
| Ingestion | Met (F1—B.1) | Met | N/A | Partial (F5 — LoadingRegion not yet applied) |
| Users | Met (F1—B.1) | Met (F3—B.2/C) | Not tested | Met (F4, F5—B.2/C) |
| Onboarding | Met (F1—B.1) | Met (F3—B.2/C) | Not tested | Met (F4—B.2/C); Partial (F5 — no DataTable, loading state not covered) |
| CityProfile | Met (F1—B.1) | Met | Not tested | Partial (F5 — LoadingRegion not yet applied) |
| Discovery | Met (F1—B.1) | Met | N/A | Met (UI shell — nothing to announce) |
| Settings | N/A (no interactives) | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| AuditLog | Met (F1—B.1) | Met | N/A | Met (F5—B.2/C) |

### 13.4 Findings F1–F7

**F1 — Tailwind v4 `ring-3` utility silently missing. Systemic across every page using shadcn primitives.**
`frontend/src/components/ui/button.tsx:7`, `input.tsx:12`, and `select.tsx:44` all ship className strings containing `focus-visible:ring-3 focus-visible:ring-ring/50`. The Tailwind v3 `ring-3` alias was removed in Tailwind v4; this project runs Tailwind v4 without a shim or theme alias. CSS bundle scan via `document.styleSheets` returns zero rules matching `.focus-visible\:ring-3:focus-visible`. Computed `--tw-ring-shadow` resolves to `0 0 #0000` and `box-shadow` is `none` on a genuinely keyboard-focused primitive. Only `focus-visible:border-ring` actually renders, producing a 1px border color swap to brand `#1F5784` — which likely fails WCAG 2.2 AA 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast (3:1 required). The global `:focus-visible` fallback in `globals.css @layer base` renders correctly but intentionally excludes `[data-slot]`, so it does not backstop the primitives. **Severity: Partial system-wide.** Remediation: three one-line edits (`ring-3` → `ring-[3px]` on Button / Input / SelectTrigger), OR a Tailwind v4 theme config alias mapping `ring-3` to `3px`. Queued for **Session B.1**. **RESOLVED in Session B.1 (this commit).** Three edits: `button.tsx:7`, `input.tsx:12`, `select.tsx:44` — `ring-3` → `ring-[3px]` (and `aria-invalid:ring-3` → `aria-invalid:ring-[3px]` on each). Post-rebuild computed-style verification: `--tw-ring-shadow` = `0 0 0 calc(3px + 0px) hsl(207 62% 32% / .5)`, `box-shadow` = `rgba(31, 87, 132, 0.5) 0px 0px 0px 3px` on keyboard-focused Button (Dashboard), Input (Onboarding "City Name"), and SelectTrigger (Requests filter bar, index 0). `focusVisible: true` on all three.

**F2 — `data-table.tsx` rows are mouse-only clickable. WCAG 2.1.1 Keyboard hard fail on Requests.**
`frontend/src/components/data-table.tsx:89-91`:
```tsx
<TableRow
  className={cn(onRowClick && "cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50")}
  onClick={() => onRowClick?.(row)}
>
```
No `tabIndex`, `role="button"`, `onKeyDown`, inner anchor, or inner button. Live DOM confirmation on Requests: `rowTabindex: null, rowRole: null, anchors: [], buttons: [], hasOnclick: true`. **A keyboard-only staff member cannot open a records request from the list.** This is the most user-visible accessibility bug in the product — a hard functional blocker, not a cosmetic gap. Blast radius today is exactly 1 page: `grep onRowClick` confirms `Requests.tsx:400` is the sole consumer. But the fix is in the shared component so any future consumer inherits it automatically. **Severity: Not Met on Requests; Met elsewhere.** Remediation: add `tabIndex={0}`, `role="button"`, and `onKeyDown={(e) => (e.key === "Enter" || e.key === " ") && (e.preventDefault(), onRowClick?.(row))}` to the TableRow in `data-table.tsx`. **One edit. Queued for Session B.1. Sequenced before F1 because severity is orders of magnitude higher.** **RESOLVED in Session B.1 (this commit).** `tabIndex={0}`, `role="button"`, and `onKeyDown` (Enter/Space with `e.preventDefault()`) added to `data-table.tsx:89`. Post-fix verification on Requests page: `<tr>` has `role="button"`, `tabIndex=0`, `focusVisible: true`; Enter key navigated to `/requests/ee112475-788d-49dc-8830-6ea8a66bb9d5`; Space key confirmed same (back-nav + re-test). Both activation keys working.

**F3 — base-ui Select hidden form-input leaks into tab order. Inferred system-wide; confirmed live on Requests.**
base-ui's `@base-ui/react/select` renders a hidden native `<input>` alongside the SelectTrigger for form integration and does not set `tabindex="-1"` on it. On the Requests filter bar (4 SelectTriggers), live tab order reads `select-trigger → phantom-input → select-trigger → phantom-input → select-trigger → phantom-input → select-trigger → phantom-input → date → date` — 10 tab stops for 6 visible controls. Inferred from shared-primitive usage to apply to every page with `<Select>`: Search, Exemptions, DataSources, Users, Onboarding, CityProfile, Requests. **Severity: Partial keyboard-nav + Partial screen-reader** on every affected page — controls are eventually reachable, just disorientingly, and an SR user hears a content-less listbox/input pair per filter. Remediation: global CSS selector to set `tabindex="-1"` on the pattern, OR an upstream fix to base-ui Select. Queued for **Session B.2 or Session C**. **RESOLVED (Session B.2/C — no code change required).** DOM inspection of Requests filter bar in base-ui v1.3.0 confirmed: hidden inputs already carry `tabindex="-1"`. Requests filter bar now reads exactly 4 tab stops for 4 visible controls. No upstream fix needed; base-ui already resolved this in v1.3.0.

**F4 — SelectTrigger missing `aria-label`. Inferred system-wide; confirmed live on Requests filter bar.**
All 4 SelectTriggers on the Requests filter bar have `aria-haspopup="listbox"` and `aria-expanded="false"` correctly, but `aria-label` is `null`. Visual labels are rendered as adjacent text, not associated via `<label for>` or `aria-labelledby`. A screen-reader user tabs onto four consecutive unlabeled listboxes and cannot disambiguate them. Inferred to affect every SelectTrigger in the app. **Severity: Partial screen-reader.** Remediation: add explicit `aria-label` prop to every SelectTrigger, or wrap each in a `<Label>` with `htmlFor`. Queued for **Session B.2 or Session C**. **RESOLVED (Session B.2/C).** `aria-label` added to all 15 SelectTriggers across 5 pages: `Exemptions.tsx` (1 — "Exemption category"), `Onboarding.tsx` (5 — "State", "Population band", "Email platform", "Dedicated IT department", "Monthly records request volume"), `Requests.tsx` (4 — "Status filter", "Department filter", "Priority filter", "Assigned to filter"), `Search.tsx` (2 — "File type filter", "Department filter"), `Users.tsx` (3 — "User role" ×2, "Department"). Verified via DOM on Requests filter bar: all 4 SelectTriggers show non-null `aria-label` attributes.

**F5 — Data-loading pages lack `aria-live` / `aria-busy` regions. Every page with async data.**
Confirmed in static source audit (7 of 10 non-live-walked pages) and live DOM on Dashboard and Requests (`ariaLiveRegions: 0, ariaBusyElements: 0`). Loading spinners do not announce state transitions to screen readers, and when data arrives the UI change is silent. **Severity: Partial screen-reader** on every page with async data. Remediation: a shared `<LoadingRegion aria-live="polite" aria-busy={isLoading}>` helper, applied to the standard `isLoading` patterns in each page. Queued for **Session B.2 or Session C**. **RESOLVED on 6 pages + 2 early-return divs (Session B.2/C).** Created `frontend/src/components/loading-region.tsx` — a thin wrapper with `aria-live="polite"` and `aria-busy={loading}`. Applied as a DataTable wrapper in: `Requests.tsx`, `AuditLog.tsx`, `Users.tsx`, `Exemptions.tsx`; and as a results wrapper in `Search.tsx`. Early-return loading `<div>` elements upgraded with `role="status"` + `aria-label` in: `Dashboard.tsx` ("Loading dashboard data"), `DataSources.tsx` ("Loading data sources"). Remaining pages with loading states (RequestDetail, Ingestion, CityProfile, Onboarding, Login) carry the partial forward to Session C.

**F6 — RequestDetail heading hierarchy is flat.**
Live walk: `<h1> = 1, <h2> = 0`. The page has at least 5 logical sections (Overview / Status, Actions, Messages, Fees, Timeline) but screen-reader heading navigation surfaces a single landmark. **Severity: Partial screen-reader** on RequestDetail. Remediation: add `<h2>` per section in `RequestDetail.tsx`. Queued for **Session B.2 or Session C**. **RESOLVED (Session B.2/C).** Added polymorphic `as` prop to `CardTitle` in `frontend/src/components/ui/card.tsx` (`as?: React.ElementType`, defaults to `"div"`). Applied `as="h2"` to 7 sections in `RequestDetail.tsx`: Request Details, Attached Documents, Timeline, Messages, Fees, Response Letter, Workflow. Note: `@radix-ui/react-slot` is not installed (project uses base-ui, not radix); the `as` pattern achieves identical semantic result without adding a dependency. Post-edit: `<h1>=1, <h2>=7` in RequestDetail.

**F7 — Non-WCAG observation: sidebar nav order buries Dashboard 9th.**
Live walk: sidebar nav order is `Search, Requests, Exemptions, Onboarding, City Profile, Sources, Ingestion, Discovery, Dashboard, Users, Settings, Audit Log`. `/` resolves to Dashboard but a keyboard user Tabs past 8 unrelated items before reaching the "home" destination. Not a WCAG failure — an information architecture choice — but it compounds with F1 (weak focus indicator makes the long Tab walk more disorienting). **Severity: observation only, not scored.** Flagged for product decision, not engineering remediation.

### 13.5 Remediation sequencing

**Session B.1** — **DONE (this commit).** Single commit, single frontend rebuild:
- **F2 first.** `data-table.tsx` TableRow `tabIndex={0}` + `role="button"` + `onKeyDown` (Enter/Space) — keyboard-only staff can now open records requests. Highest user-visible severity in the whole audit. Verified: Enter and Space both navigated to `/requests/<uuid>` from keyboard focus.
- **F1 second.** `ring-3` → `ring-[3px]` on Button, Input, SelectTrigger — 3px brand-color ring restored across every primitive system-wide. Verified: `--tw-ring-shadow` = `0 0 0 calc(3px + 0px) hsl(207 62% 32% / .5)` and `box-shadow` = `rgba(31, 87, 132, 0.5) 0px 0px 0px 3px` on all three primitives after a real Tab keystroke.

**Session B.2/C** — **DONE (this commit).** F3–F6 all resolved:
- **F3**: DOM-confirmed resolved in base-ui v1.3.0 — no code change needed. Requests filter bar: 4 tab stops for 4 controls.
- **F4**: `aria-label` on all 15 SelectTriggers across 5 pages. DOM-verified on Requests.
- **F5**: `LoadingRegion` (`aria-live="polite"`, `aria-busy`) component; applied to Requests, AuditLog, Users, Exemptions, Search; `role="status"` on Dashboard + DataSources early-return divs.
- **F6**: CardTitle `as` prop; 7 `<h2>` sections in RequestDetail. `<h1>=1, <h2>=7` verified.
- **Dialog focus trap**: Verified on Exemptions new-exemption modal. `focusInsideDialog=true` on open; Tab cycles within dialog; Escape is a pre-existing controlled-dialog behavior (not introduced by our changes).
- **Form error handling (1d)**: **DONE — Session C.** `role="alert"` added to error containers in Login, Users (×3), Exemptions, DataSources, Onboarding, Requests (8 locations / 6 pages). `setError("")` clears before each submit — unmount/remount pattern guarantees re-announcement on repeated errors. Commits `226453c`, `98791d6`, `47b92a3`.
- **F5 completion**: **DONE — Session C.** `role="status"` + `aria-label` added to loading skeleton `<div>` in RequestDetail, Ingestion, CityProfile. All 7 affected pages now covered. Commit `b8d60ae`.
- **Search `aria-live` restructure**: **DONE — Session C.** Persistent `<div aria-live="polite" aria-busy={loading} aria-label="Search results">` wrapper gated on `(loading || hasSearched)`. Replaces `LoadingRegion` inside `{results && !loading}` — `aria-busy` now transitions `true → false` when results arrive. Commit `bdfc230`.

**Session C — COMPLETE.** All code changes landed. Source-level verification: 13 ARIA attribute placements confirmed via grep; TypeScript build EXIT:0. Live Chrome MCP DOM checks blocked by backend not running in this session.

### 13.6 Content Design Rules
Lead with action: "Tell us what records you need" not "Records Request Submission Form"
Explain why data is requested when not obvious.
Never hide important policy terms only in tooltips.
Every closed/denied request shows reason in human language plus formal basis.
Replace jargon: "responsive documents" → "records found for release"
Every error state explains: what happened, how to fix it, how to get help.
[v1.0.0] Smart empty states provide contextual guidance.

## 17. Next Priorities
Based on the repository as it exists now:
1. Accessibility audit — in progress.
   1a. Focus visibility — **DONE (Session B.1, this commit).** The global `:focus-visible` outline fallback from `2663836` (Session A) is Met on bare `<a>`, `[role="link"]`, and non-primitive `[tabindex]` elements. The shadcn primitive `ring-3` omission (F1) is now resolved — `ring-[3px]` ships on button.tsx, input.tsx, select.tsx; 3px brand-color ring confirmed via computed-style probe post-rebuild. See §13.4 F1 and §13.2.
   1b. Keyboard navigation audit — **DONE** in Session B (this commit). 14-page walk (4 live via Chrome MCP, 10 via source audit) with per-page WCAG 2.2 AA scoring in §13.3 and 7 findings F1–F7 in §13.4. Session B.1 handles the two blocking remediations; F3–F6 queued for Session B.2 or Session C.
   1c. **Session B.1 — F2 + F1 remediation — DONE (this commit).** F2 first (WCAG 2.1.1 hard fail): `data-table.tsx` TableRow `tabIndex={0}` + `role="button"` + `onKeyDown` for Enter/Space — keyboard-only staff can now open records requests. F1 second: `ring-3` → `ring-[3px]` on button.tsx, input.tsx, select.tsx — 3px brand-color ring restored on all shadcn primitives. Both fixes verified via Chrome MCP computed-style probe after rebuild. See §13.4 F1, F2 for verification evidence.
   1d. Form error handling — **DONE (Session C).** `role="alert"` added to error containers across 8 locations in 6 pages. Unmount/remount pattern via `setError("")` ensures re-announcement. Commits `226453c`, `98791d6`, `47b92a3`.
   1e. Screen reader audit — **DONE (code — Session C).** All F3–F6 ARIA code changes landed. F5 complete across all 7 pages. Search `aria-live` restructured with persistent `aria-busy` transitions. Source-level verification: 13 ARIA attributes confirmed; TypeScript build EXIT:0. Full NVDA/VoiceOver listening verification deferred pending backend availability.
2. **Liaison scoping — DONE (this commit).** `require_role` lowered to LIAISON on read endpoints (`GET /requests/`, `GET /requests/stats`, `GET /requests/{id}`, `POST /search/query`); search dept filter injected automatically for all non-admin users with a department; nav items (Users/Audit Log/Onboarding) hidden + route-guarded for LIAISON role. 278 tests pass.
3. **Deadline notifications — DONE (this commit).** `check_deadline_approaching` fires for requests due within 3 days; `check_deadline_overdue` fires for past-deadline requests. Both run daily via Celery beat. Assigned staff is the recipient; unassigned requests skipped. 23-hour deduplication. 278→287 tests.
4. Discovery implementation — **DEFERRED to v1.2+.** Discovery.tsx shell removed from nav and routing (`8fe19ba`). Active discovery is out of scope for v1.1.
5. Connector expansion — **DONE (d335c5b).** `RestApiConnector` + `OdbcConnector` shipped. 61 connector tests passing. See `CHANGELOG.md`.
   5a. **P6a — Idempotency contract split** — **DONE (`e462c7e`, 2026-04-16).** Dedup contract split by connector type: binary sources use `(source_id, file_hash)`, structured REST/ODBC use `(source_id, source_path)`. Canonical JSON serialization + envelope-pollution detection at test-connection. `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` + partial UNIQUE indexes (`uq_documents_binary_hash`, `uq_documents_structured_path`) prevent concurrent-update races. Atomic chunk/embedding replacement on content UPDATE. Migration 014. 382+19 tests passing. See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-16-p6a-idempotency-design.md`.
   5b. **P6b — Cron scheduler rewrite** — **DONE (`c670ef1`, 2026-04-17).** `schedule_minutes` interval replaced with 5-field cron `sync_schedule` via croniter (Apache 2.0). `schedule_enabled` toggle preserves expression when paused. Trigger logic: `get_next(datetime) <= now`. Rolling 7-day (2016-tick) min-interval validation rejects adversarial crons; 5-min floor. UTC evaluation with UI disclosure. Allowlist migration (13 entries) converts legacy intervals; non-allowlist values null + recorded in `_migration_015_report`. Migration 015 also drops `schedule_minutes` and adds 8 P7 stub columns. 395/397 tests passing (+13 new). D-SCHED-5 three-state card display deferred to P7. See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-16-p6b-scheduler-design.md`.
   5c. **P7 — Sync failures, circuit breaker, UI polish** — **DONE (`32ceb9c`, 2026-04-17).** Per-record failure tracking (`sync_failures` table), two-layer retry (task-level 3×30s→90s→270s + record-level 5×/7-day), circuit breaker (5 full-run failures → `sync_paused`, unpause grace threshold=2), `health_status` computed at response time via LEFT JOIN (circuit_open > degraded > healthy). Option B SourceCard layout with `FailedRecordsPanel` (5 states: loading/empty/populated/error + circuit-open banner), Sync Now button with exponential backoff polling (5s→10s→20s→30s, 15-min timeout, elapsed display). 429/Retry-After honored at connector layer (capped 600s, D-FAIL-12). IntegrityError → `permanently_failed` (D-FAIL-10). `sync_run_log` one row per run. Bulk retry/dismiss actions. `formatNextRun()` UTC+local display in wizard Step 3. `conftest` migrated to `alembic upgrade head` subprocess (true migration parity). **P7 QA pass (`301c4f3`, 2026-04-17):** Retry-After crash fix (ValueError on malformed headers → backoff); grace period activation fix (DB-persisted `sync_paused_reason` sentinel replaces transient Python attribute); SourceCard + FailedRecordsPanel ARIA accessibility (role/img, aria-label, aria-live, aria-hidden, role/region, role/alert); `⚠️` copy fix. 4 adversarial Retry-After tests + 2 grace-period integration tests added. **432 backend tests passing (full Docker suite, 0 failures, 0 errors); 5 frontend tests passing** at time of this P7 entry. Test suite hardened in v1.1.0 post-audit: per-test DB recreation via `DROP DATABASE WITH FORCE`, per-test async engine, `_SessionProxy` pattern, `db_session_factory` engine disposal, `ingest_file` connector_type + SELECT FOR UPDATE to close binary-ingest race. (Current count is 556 backend + 7 frontend following T2A–T3A remediation.) *(5a–5c shipped prior to Rule 9 enforcement. Rule 9 deliverables produced separately in `c433beb`.)* See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-16-p7-sync-failures-design.md`.
6. Spec alignment — **DONE**. The in-repo `docs/UNIFIED-SPEC.md` is now this v3.1 document, kept current through commit `2663836` + this hotfix. (Completed alongside the SENT removal and notification_log/exemption_rules drift fixes; see migrations 010 and 011.)
7. Public portal buildout — implement the requester-facing surface only after internal staff workflows are stable and fully documented.
8. CHANGELOG font correction — **DONE** in `2663836`. The v1.0.0 entry and the actual wiring now both reflect Geist Variable.
9. **v1.1.0 release readiness — Rule 9 mandatory deliverables** — **DONE (`c433beb`, `9c1d98b`, `23f0655`, 2026-04-17).** `coder-ui-qa-test` skill (Hard Rule 9) requires five artifact classes before any push: (a) professional UML diagrams, (b) README in four formats, (c) three-section User Manual in three formats, (d) landing page with required action buttons, (e) GitHub Discussions seed. All five produced and committed. `docs/diagrams/` contains 6 Mermaid `.mmd` sources + 6 SVG renders (Class, Component, Sequence, Deployment, Activity). README.md/.txt/.docx/.pdf all in repo root. USER-MANUAL.md/.docx/.pdf with Sections A (end-user), B (technical), C (architectural). `docs/index.html` redesigned with 5 action buttons. `docs/github-discussions-seed.md` contains 9 seeded posts across Announcements/Q&A/Ideas/Show and Tell/General. Landing page User Manual link corrected in `23f0655`. Download Installer buttons currently point to `/raw/master/` branch files; will update to `/releases/download/` assets when v1.1.0 GitHub Release is tagged. See D-PROC-1.

## 17.x Decision Log (P6a / P6b / P7)

Decisions that constrain implementation. Each links to the specific test function that proves it. Future devs: if you want to change a decision, update the test first.

| ID | Decision | Why | Proof Test (file::function) |
|---|---|---|---|
| D-IDEM-1 | Split idempotency contract: binary connectors dedup by `(source_id, file_hash)`; structured connectors (REST/ODBC) dedup by `(source_id, source_path)`. file_hash = change detector for structured. | REST/ODBC hash non-determinism confirmed in code audit — raw response bytes include rotating envelope fields. Same CDC/ETL pattern as Airbyte/Fivetran. | `test_pipeline_idempotency.py::test_rest_envelope_timestamp_same_document` |
| D-IDEM-2 | `data_key` optional (null = hash root). Dotted-path only (no JSONPath). Pollution detection at test-connection time is the enforcement guardrail. | sort_keys fixes key order, not envelope values. Double-fetch warning converts silent bug to test-time signal. | `test_rest_connector.py::test_data_key_nested_extraction` |
| D-IDEM-3 | Test-connection calls fetch() twice (500ms apart), warns on hash mismatch with differing key list. | Admin finds misconfiguration during config, not 3 weeks post-GA. | `test_datasources_router.py::test_test_connection_pollution_warning` |
| D-IDEM-4 | source_path frozen at GA. ODBC: `{table}/{url_encoded_pk}`, unquoted in fetch() before SQL. REST: `{base_url}{endpoint_path}/{url_encoded_id}`. Max 2048 chars. | Format changes after GA = silent duplicates. Decode gap in ODBC fetch() would lose records with special-char PKs. | `test_odbc_connector.py::test_source_path_encode_decode_special_chars` |
| D-IDEM-5 | source_path change upstream = new document, orphaned old row. No fuzzy matching. | Fuzzy matching introduces its own failure modes. | `test_pipeline_idempotency.py::test_structured_record_content_change_updates_document` |
| D-IDEM-6 | Deletion detection is a Known Gap in v1. | Out of scope; flag for v1.2. | N/A |
| D-IDEM-7 | On UPDATE (content change): DELETE existing Chunk rows and pgvector embeddings in same transaction before re-generating. Atomic: no stale search results. | Stale embeddings after content update = incorrect search results. This is a correctness bug for a civic records search product. | `test_pipeline_idempotency.py::test_update_deletes_old_chunks_before_reembed` |
| D-IDEM-8 | ingest_structured_record uses SELECT … FOR UPDATE before comparing hashes. | Without lock: two concurrent workers both detect content change, race to update, produce non-deterministic chunk counts. | `test_pipeline_idempotency.py::test_concurrent_update_select_for_update` |
| D-IDEM-9 | Downstream consumers of documents table must watch updated_at, not just created_at. Audit of known consumers required before P6a ships. Current known: ingestion pipeline only. | With source-path identity, content-changed re-fetches are UPDATEs not INSERTs. Insert-only watchers miss updates silently. | N/A — action item, not testable |
| D-IDEM-10 | Existing structured-source documents (if any) deduped by MAX(ingested_at) per (source_id, source_path) before UNIQUE constraint lands. State explicitly in migration if no rows exist. | UNIQUE migration that silently fails on existing duplicates is a Friday-night incident. | `test_migration_014.py::test_connector_type_backfill` |
| D-SCHED-1 | `sync_schedule` (cron, croniter Apache 2.0) replaces `schedule_minutes`. `schedule_enabled` boolean preserves expression on toggle-off. Correct trigger logic: `get_next(datetime) <= now()`. | Interval scheduling drifts. get_prev() > anchor is almost never true — original spec had inverted logic that would never trigger. | `test_scheduler.py::test_overdue_source_triggers` |
| D-SCHED-2 | Min interval validated via rolling 7-day sample (2016 intervals). Floor: 5 minutes. | Adversarial cron `*/1 0 * * *` fires 60×/hour in hour 0. Single get_next() check misses this. | `test_scheduler.py::test_min_interval_adversarial_cron` |
| D-SCHED-3 | Cron evaluated in UTC. UI shows both UTC and local time ("2:00 AM UTC / 8:00 PM MDT"). Wizard discloses "All schedules run in UTC." | Admin typing `0 2 * * *` intends 2am local; gets 2am UTC without disclosure. Compliance audit trail discrepancy. | `test_scheduler.py::test_cron_evaluated_in_utc` |
| D-SCHED-4 | schedule_minutes migration uses explicit allowlist. Non-allowlist values (e.g., 45) → sync_schedule=NULL + migration report entry. No silent incorrect cron (*/45 is not a 45-min interval). | `*/45 * * * *` fires at :00 and :45 only, leaving a 15-min gap. Silent wrong schedule is worse than no schedule. | `test_migration_015.py::test_schedule_minutes_non_allowlist_nulled_with_report` |
| D-SCHED-5 | Three-state card display: Manual (`sync_schedule NULL or disabled`), Scheduled ("Next: Apr 17 at 2:00 AM UTC"), Paused ("Paused — check failed records"). | Admin must know at a glance whether source is running, waiting, or broken. Missing paused state = silent compliance gap. | `test_datasources_router.py::test_next_sync_at_returned_in_list` |
| D-FAIL-1 | Two retry layers: task-level (3 retries, 30s→90s→270s, 10-min cap) for transient errors; record-level (5 retries OR 7 days, one per tick, N=100/T=90s cap) for persistent failures. Handoff: task exhaustion → sync_failures row. | Task-level absorbs VPN hiccups without polluting failures table. Without it, every county firewall blip trips circuit breaker via noise. | `test_sync_runner_retry_layers.py::test_task_retry_exhaustion_creates_sync_failure` |
| D-FAIL-2 | Partial failure: cursor advances past successful records. Failed records in sync_failures. | All-or-nothing cursor = one poisoned record re-fetches 50k records nightly forever. | `test_sync_runner_cursor.py::test_partial_failure_cursor_advances_past_successes` |
| D-FAIL-3 | Retry ordering: retrying rows first, then discover(). Per-run cap: N=100 OR T=90s. | Resolving existing failures > expanding backlog. Cap prevents worker pile-up on large queues. | `test_sync_runner_retry_cap.py::test_retry_cap_by_count` |
| D-FAIL-4 | Circuit breaker: full-run failure = authenticate() throws OR discover() throws OR all fetches fail. Zero-work (discover=0, no retries) does NOT move counter. Any success resets counter to 0. Zero new + retry-only successes = NOT a full-run failure. | Explicit rule prevents false positives (0 records = fail) and false negatives (partial success = fail). | `test_circuit_breaker.py::test_retry_success_with_zero_new_records_resets_counter` |
| D-FAIL-5 | Unpause grace: threshold=2 for first post-unpause window, returns to 5 after success. | Admin gets immediate feedback if creds still wrong, not 5-cycle wait. "Unpause didn't work" confusion prevented. | `test_circuit_breaker.py::test_unpause_grace_period_threshold_is_2` |
| D-FAIL-6 | Dismiss = soft delete (status=dismissed + dismissed_at + dismissed_by). Hard delete prohibited. | "We chose not to ingest this record" is a compliance artifact. Audit trail must be preserved. | `test_sync_failures.py::test_dismiss_sets_dismissed_status_not_deletes` |
| D-FAIL-7 | 404 during task-level retry = tombstone, not retrying. | Chasing deleted upstream records forever wastes workers. Tombstone = explicit "not our data anymore." | `test_sync_failures.py::test_404_response_creates_tombstone` |
| D-FAIL-8 | health_status computed at response time: sync_paused=circuit_open; consecutive_failure_count>0 OR active sync_failures=degraded; else healthy. Single LEFT JOIN, not stored field. | Avoids cache staleness. Stored field would require sync runner to update on every failure — adds complexity. | `test_datasources_router.py::test_health_status_degraded_on_failure_count` |
| D-FAIL-9 | sync_run_log: one row per run, no coupling to retry logic. Minimal fields. | "Why did this sync run at 2:13 not 2:00" is unanswerable without it. Conflating with sync_failures complicates both. | `test_sync_run_log.py::test_each_sync_creates_one_run_log_row` |
| D-FAIL-10 | Pipeline error classification: IntegrityError → immediately permanently_failed (no task retry); IOError/Ollama timeout → task retry. | IntegrityError is a code bug; retrying wastes workers and produces misleading metrics. Transient infra errors self-resolve. | `test_sync_runner_pipeline_failures.py::test_integrity_error_skips_task_retry` |
| D-FAIL-11 | Bulk actions: retry-all and dismiss-all on sync_failures. | Admin with 50 stuck records will not click Retry 50 times. Hotfix later is worse. | `test_sync_failures_router.py::test_retry_all_permanently_failed` |
| D-UI-1 | Sync Now button stays "Syncing…" + disabled until last_sync_at advances (exponential backoff polling: 5s→10s→20s→30s). Timeout 15min. Shows elapsed time. **Required automated test (not manual QA).** | Button that lies about completion = shipped broken feature. Polling refactors silently break it without test. | `DataSourceCard.test.tsx::test_sync_now_button_stays_disabled_until_completion` |
| D-UI-2 | Notifications: created_by recipient, fallback to ADMIN-role users. Triggers: circuit-open + recovery. Rate-limit: batch within 5-min window → digest. | First-failure is noisy. Circuit-open is the signal. 10-source simultaneous outage → 1 digest not 10 emails. | `test_sync_notifications.py::test_circuit_open_fires_notification` |
| D-FAIL-12 | 429 with `Retry-After` header honored at task-level (not enqueued as sync_failures). Capped at 600s to prevent worker starvation. | 429 is transient and expected on rate-limited municipal APIs. Task-level is the right layer — polluting sync_failures with rate-limit events would trip circuit breaker on noise. | `test_rest_connector.py::test_429_retry_after_header_honored` |
| D-FAIL-13 | sync_failures and sync_run_log both CASCADE on DataSource delete. | Orphaned failure rows for a deleted source are noise. Admin deleting a source intends to remove all associated state. | `test_sync_failures.py::test_cascade_delete_removes_failures_and_run_log` |
| D-TENANT-1 | CivicRecords is single-tenant per install (one city per deployment). No org-level isolation within a deployment. All admin-role users within the installation share access to all sources. | Architecture is per-city SaaS/self-hosted. Multi-tenant within a single install is not a v1 requirement. | `test_datasources_router.py` — admin-role access tests (existing) |
| D-PROC-1 | Every Claude Code / Cowork session touching this repo MUST load the `coder-ui-qa-test` skill as its first action. The skill defines the Principal Engineer / Senior UI Designer / Senior QA Engineer standards and enforces Hard Rule 9 (mandatory deliverables gate). No push is permitted until all five Rule 9 artifact classes exist on disk. Override phrase: `"override rule 9"` (literal, from human in chat only). | The five Rule 9 deliverables (UML diagrams, README ×4 formats, USER-MANUAL ×3 formats/sections, landing page with 4 action buttons, GitHub Discussions seed) were absent from the initial v1.1.0 development because the skill was not loaded. Retroactive production required three commits after the fact. This decision ensures the gap cannot recur. | Verified via `CLAUDE.md` Hard Rule 0 (project-level) and the `coder-ui-qa-test` skill `§ HARD RULES §9`. |

## 18. Engineering Acceptance Criteria
Every component must support loading, empty, error, and disabled states.
Every workflow must support keyboard-only completion.
Role-based permissions change available actions, not layout or naming.
All status transitions write to audit log automatically.
All status transitions dispatch notifications (if template exists).
Public status pages understandable without staff login.
Onboarding completable by clerk alone without IT involvement.
Network discovery requires explicit IT opt-in.
Every connector authorization is audit-logged.
Health checks surfaced on Dashboard.
Credentials encrypted AES-256 at rest. Never logged, exported, or returned.
Coverage gap map auto-updates.
Zero false negatives for Tier 1 regex PII detection.
All redaction is proposal-only; humans approve.
CJIS compliance gate enforced for public safety connectors.
All LLM calls route through central client with prompt injection sanitization.
ReDoS protection on all admin-entered regex patterns.
VBA macros stripped from all ingested DOCX/XLSX files.
**Process criteria (coder-ui-qa-test skill enforcement):**
- `coder-ui-qa-test` skill MUST be loaded as the first action of every session touching code, tests, documentation, or deployment — no exceptions.
- All five Rule 9 mandatory deliverables (UML diagrams, README ×4, USER-MANUAL ×3 sections/formats, landing page with action buttons, GitHub Discussions seed) MUST exist on disk and be verified before any `git push` or release.
- Every coding task MUST close with a Verification Log containing evidence of what was verified — terminal output unedited, files read listed, tests run with counts, runtime behavior described, documentation artifacts accounted for. "It should work" is not evidence.

## 19. Canonical Guidance for Future Spec Work
For future documentation, use this precedence order:
0. **Verification Log** — terminal output, DOM inspection results, and runtime evidence from the session that produced the change. This is the ground truth. It supersedes everything below.
1. Repository code and route surface
2. Repository tests
3. CHANGELOG entries
4. Repository README
5. Design/spec prose
When those disagree, do not preserve the older narrative claim just because it sounds cleaner.

## Appendix B: Bottom-Line Summary
CivicRecords AI at v1.1.0 is a substantially complete internal staff platform. In three releases over two days, then a security remediation sprint (T2A–T3A), the codebase grew from an 80-test foundation to a 556-test system with department-level access control, 50-state exemption coverage, a complete notification pipeline, a central LLM client with prompt injection sanitization, fee waiver workflows, a rich text editor, macro stripping, search enhancements, coverage gap monitoring, user management improvements, and post-v1.1.0 auth/authz hardening across 24 department-scoped handlers, credential redaction, bootstrap hardening, and SSRF protection.
The system is well beyond a simple MVP: it has professional security hardening (ReDoS protection, self-demotion guards, credential redaction, SSRF host validation, FIRST_ADMIN_PASSWORD validation, macro stripping), operational polish (retry, priority indicators, citation rendering, empty states), and accessibility foundations (44px touch targets, skip navigation, icon+color badges, full F1–F6 keyboard/SR audit complete).
What remains: at-rest encryption for `connection_config` (ENG-001 / Tier 6); connector taxonomy unification (T3B); test-connection truthfulness (T3C); OpenAPI typegen (T3D); UI runtime and accessibility polish (Tier 4); first-boot truth cleanup (Tier 5); public-facing portal; full active network discovery; GIS connector. REST API and ODBC connectors shipped post-v1.1.0.
This document (v3.1) is the single source of truth and is now the in-repo `docs/UNIFIED-SPEC.md`.
