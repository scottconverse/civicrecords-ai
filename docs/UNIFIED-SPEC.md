## 1. Purpose of This Document
This is the single source of truth for CivicRecords AI. It merges comprehensive design detail with implementation status verified directly against the repository at commit head. Every feature is tagged with its actual implementation state.
When narrative claims and repository evidence disagree, repository evidence wins. This document replaces all prior spec versions.

### 1.1 Version Alignment (Resolved)
As of v1.1.0, version numbers are aligned across all four authoritative files:
backend/app/config.py: APP_VERSION = "1.1.0"
backend/pyproject.toml: version = "1.1.0"
frontend/package.json: version = "1.1.0"
CHANGELOG.md: [1.1.0] - 2026-04-13
The version drift documented in prior spec versions has been resolved. The CHANGELOG now covers three releases: 0.1.0 (foundation), 1.0.0 (design system + core features), and 1.1.0 (department scoping, compliance, and feature sprint).

## 2. Product Summary

### 2.1 What It Is
Open-source, locally-hosted AI system for municipal open records request processing. Runs on commodity hardware via Docker. No cloud, no vendor lock-in, no telemetry.

### 2.2 North-Star Statement
Any resident should be able to search for public records, request what is missing, and understand the status of their request without needing insider knowledge of city government.
Staff corollary: Any records clerk should be able to triage, search, review, redact, and respond to records requests from a single calm interface without falling back to email, spreadsheets, or paper.

### 2.3 What It Is Not
Not a records management system — it indexes and searches what already exists.
Not a legal advisor — it surfaces suggestions, staff make all decisions.
Not a cloud service — every deployment is a sovereign instance owned by the city.
Not a public-facing portal yet — internal staff tool first. Public portal is [PLANNED].

### 2.4 Design Stance & Principles
Transparent, calm, accessible, and government-appropriate. Trust through clarity, not visual excitement.
Clarity over bureaucracy — residents should not need to understand government structure.
Transparency over mystery — statuses, timelines, costs, and next actions always visible.
Consistency over one-off screens — shared patterns reduce confusion and cost.
Accessibility over compliance theater — forms must be usable, not merely valid.
Operational calm over case chaos — staff views aid triage, not add clutter.
Human-in-the-loop always — no auto-redaction, no auto-denial, no auto-release.

### 2.5 Current Product Scope
As of v1.1.0, the system implements:
Local deployment on a single-machine Docker stack (7 services)
Internal authentication with 6-role RBAC hierarchy
Department-level access controls with staff scoping
Document ingestion (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, CSV, email, HTML, text) with macro stripping
Hybrid search (semantic + keyword) with department filtering and CSV export
Request lifecycle management (10 statuses) with priority indicators
Exemption detection: 180 rules across 51 jurisdictions, Tier 1 PII detection, rule testing with ReDoS protection
Fee tracking with estimation, line items, and waiver workflows
Response letter generation with TipTap rich text editor
Notification service: 12 templates, SMTP delivery, dispatched via PATCH dynamic dispatch and 4 dedicated endpoints (see §8.3 for the audited matrix)
Operational analytics and dashboard with coverage gap indicators
Guided onboarding with LLM-powered adaptive interview
Municipal systems catalog (12 domains, 25+ vendors)
Connector framework (file system, IMAP email, manual drop)
Central LLM client with context manager, token budgeting, and prompt injection sanitization
Compliance templates (5 documents) and model registry
Hash-chained audit logging with CSV/JSON export
274 automated tests across 45 test modules
Not yet implemented: public resident portal, public search/request tracking, full active network discovery engine, cross-instance federation workflows, liaison department-scoped UI (role exists, full scoping not complete), Tier 2/3 redaction.

## 3. User Groups & RBAC

### 3.1 Staff Users

| User Group | Primary Need | Design Response |
|---|---|---|
| City clerk / records officer | Triage, route, communicate, and complete requests. | Queue views, routing rules, templates, SLA timers, full event history. |
| Department liaison | Provide documents and answer scoped questions quickly. | Scoped assignment view, internal notes, due dates, one-click return to records team. |
| Legal / reviewer | Review exemptions, redactions, and sensitive material. | Review queue, exemption tags, redaction ledger, approval state. |
| City IT administrator | Install, configure, and maintain the system. | Docker Compose, admin panel, model management, audit export. |

### 3.2 Public Users [PLANNED]

| User Group | Primary Need | Design Response |
|---|---|---|
| Resident / first-time requester | Submit a request without knowing the exact record title. | Guided request flow, plain-language examples, estimated turnaround. |
| Journalist / researcher | Search existing records and request additional material. | Robust search, saved filters, exportable results, request history. |

### 3.3 RBAC Role Hierarchy [IMPLEMENTED]
All 6 roles are defined in UserRole enum with a numeric hierarchy. Role hierarchy enforced via check_department_access() and role-threshold checks on endpoints.

| Role | Level | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| admin | 6 | Full system access, user management, configuration, model registry | [IMPLEMENTED] |
| reviewer | 5 | Everything staff can do + approve/reject responses and exemption flags | [IMPLEMENTED] |
| staff | 4 | Request management, search, ingestion, exemption review, fee management | [IMPLEMENTED] |
| liaison | 3 | Department-scoped via check_department_access(); can view department resources but cannot create requests or manage exemptions | [IMPLEMENTED] |
| read_only | 2 | View dashboards and reports only | [IMPLEMENTED] |
| public | 1 | Submit requests, track own requests, search published records | [IMPLEMENTED — role defined, no public endpoints yet] |

Service accounts with hashed API keys (SHA-256) enable instance-to-instance federation access.

### 5.3 Central LLM Client [NEW in v1.1.0]
All LLM generation calls route through backend/app/llm/client.py, which enforces:
Context manager token budgeting on every call
Prompt injection sanitization
Model-registry context window scaling (reads context_window_size from model_registry table)
Refactored consumers: exemptions reviewer, search synthesizer, ingestion extractor, onboarding interview.

### 5.4 Context Manager [IMPLEMENTED]
backend/app/llm/context_manager.py implements priority-based context assembly for local LLM calls:
TokenBudget dataclass with configurable allocations: system_instruction (500), request_context (500), retrieved_chunks (5000), exemption_rules (500), output_reservation (1500), safety_margin (192)
estimate_tokens() function (~1 token per 4 chars)
assemble_context() — prioritizes system > request > top-k chunks > exemption rules within budget
ContextBlock data structure for organized prompt assembly
Model-aware budgeting: reads context_window_size from model_registry, auto-adjusts when admin switches models

### 7.2 Typography
Note: The frontend uses Geist Variable (@fontsource-variable/geist v5.2.8). The CHANGELOG v1.0.0 references "Inter typography scale" but the installed font is Geist. Typography targets below should be read against Geist metrics.

| Element | Current | Target |
|---|---|---|
| H1 (page title) | Not used | 36px / 700 weight |
| H2 (section head) | 20px / 600 weight | 28px / 600 weight |
| H3 (subsection) | 14px / 500 weight | 22px / 600 weight |
| Body | 16px / 400 weight | 16px / 400 weight |
| Labels | 14px / mixed | 13px / 500 weight / uppercase / 0.05em |
| Stat card numbers | Mixed | 36px / 700 weight for primary metrics |

### 7.3 Status Badges
Every badge includes an icon — never color-only. StatusBadge component maps color+icon across request, document, and exemption domains.

| Status | Color Role | Icon | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| Received | info (blue) | Inbox | — |
| Clarification needed | warning (amber) | MessageCircle | — |
| Assigned | info (blue) | UserCheck | — |
| Searching | info (blue) | Search | — |
| In review | warning (amber) | Eye | — |
| Ready for release | success (green) | CheckCircle | — |
| Drafted | info (blue) | FileText | — |
| Approved | success (green) | ShieldCheck | — |
| Fulfilled | success (green) | Send | — |
| Closed | neutral (gray) | Archive | — |

### 7.4 Priority Badges [NEW in v1.1.0]

| Priority | Color | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Urgent | Red/danger badge | Legally mandated expedited processing |
| Expedited | Amber/warning badge | High-priority by policy or volume |
| Normal | Blue/info badge | Standard processing timeline |
| Low | Gray/neutral badge | Bulk or low-urgency requests |

### 7.5 Button Variants (3 only)

| Variant | Use | Style |
|---|---|---|
| Primary | Main page action (New Request, Submit for Review) | Filled brand.primary, white text |
| Secondary | Supporting actions (Search & Attach, Export) | Outlined brand.primary border, transparent bg |
| Ghost | Tertiary actions (Sign out, Cancel, Back) | Text-only, hover bg surface.subtle |

### 7.6 Reusable Components [IMPLEMENTED]
StatCard — metric display with loading, empty, and error states
PageHeader — consistent page titles
EmptyState — smart contextual guidance ("No flags reviewed yet" not "0.0%")
DataTable — sortable, filterable tables with loading states
StatusBadge — color+icon mapping across all domains

## 8. Workflow Patterns

### 8.1 Request Lifecycle [IMPLEMENTED]
10 statuses: [Received] → [Clarification Needed]? → [Assigned] → [Searching] → [In Review] → [Ready for Release] → [Drafted] → [Approved] → [Fulfilled] → [Closed]
Every status transition writes to request_timeline, writes to audit_log, triggers notification dispatch (if template exists), and updates records_requests.status.

The lifecycle has 10 statuses. The legacy `sent` value was removed in migration 010 — it was a leftover from the original v0.1.0 enum, marked in code as a "legacy alias for fulfilled" and orphaned by the broken Mark Fulfilled UX path (see section 8.3). Migration 010 collapses any historical `sent` rows into `fulfilled` and drops the enum value via the standard rename-recreate dance.
### 8.2 Response Letter Generation [IMPLEMENTED]
Clerk clicks [Generate Response Letter] on Request Detail.
Central LLM client assembles context within token budget via context manager.
LLM generates draft letter (labeled "AI-GENERATED DRAFT — REQUIRES HUMAN REVIEW").
Clerk edits in TipTap rich text editor (bold, italic, underline, bullet/ordered lists). Content stored as HTML.
Submit for Approval → Supervisor reviews → Approve → Send.

### 8.3 Notification Dispatch [IMPLEMENTED]
12 notification templates seeded. Dispatch is via the PATCH `/{request_id}` endpoint, which fires `queue_notification()` with a dynamically-built `event_type` of `request_{new_status}` for every reachable status transition. In addition, four dedicated POST endpoints (`submit_for_review`, `mark_ready_for_release`, `approve_request`, `reject_request`) call `queue_notification()` directly. `city_name` is sourced from `CityProfile` for template rendering. SMTP delivery is performed asynchronously by `smtp_delivery.py` driven by Celery beat (60s interval). Notification rows enter `notification_log` with `status='queued'` and are picked up on the next beat tick.

The Mark Fulfilled UX path was repaired in this release. The "Mark Fulfilled" button in `RequestDetail.tsx` had been pointing at `POST /requests/{id}/sent` — a route that does not exist — so every click 404'd and no notifications ever fired from that path. The button now PATCHes `status='fulfilled'`, which routes through the dynamic dispatch and produces the expected `request_fulfilled` notification. End-to-end manual verification (2026-04-14): a request walked through `searching → in_review → ready_for_release → approved → fulfilled` produces exactly five `notification_log` rows, one per transition, with rendered subjects.

#### Dispatch matrix (audited)

| Template event_type | Template seeded | Dispatch path | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `request_received` | yes | `create_request` (no call site) | OPEN — template-only; `create_request` does not yet call `queue_notification()` |
| `request_clarification_needed` | yes | PATCH dynamic | wired |
| `request_assigned` | yes | PATCH dynamic | wired |
| `request_searching` | yes | PATCH dynamic | wired |
| `request_in_review` | yes | PATCH dynamic + dedicated `submit_for_review` | wired |
| `request_ready_for_release` | yes | PATCH dynamic + dedicated `mark_ready_for_release` | wired |
| `request_drafted` | yes | PATCH dynamic + dedicated `reject_request` | wired |
| `request_approved` | yes | PATCH dynamic + dedicated `approve_request` | wired |
| `request_fulfilled` | yes | PATCH dynamic | wired (was unreachable until UI fix) |
| `request_closed` | yes | PATCH dynamic | wired |
| `request_deadline_approaching` | yes | Celery beat (no router call site) | OPEN — beat scheduler work, separate from router dispatch |
| `request_deadline_overdue` | yes | Celery beat (no router call site) | OPEN — beat scheduler work, separate from router dispatch |

The `sent` event type and the legacy `RequestStatus.SENT` enum value were removed in migration 010 (`010_remove_sent_status`). See section 8.1 for the lifecycle update.

#### Conceptual recipients (target design)

| Event | Recipient | Channel |
|---|---|---|
| Request received | Requester | Email |
| Clarification needed | Requester | Email |
| Request assigned | Liaison | In-app |
| Deadline approaching (3 days) | Assigned staff | In-app + Email |
| Deadline overdue | Assigned staff + Admin | In-app + Email |
| Records ready | Requester | Email |
| Request closed | Requester | Email |

### 8.4 Fee Workflow [IMPLEMENTED]
POST /requests/{id}/estimate-fees — staff enters page count, system calculates from fee schedule rates
Fee line items tracked per request with automatic total calculation
Fee waiver workflow: create waiver (indigency/public_interest/media/government/other) → approve/deny → automatic fee_status update on approval

### 8.5 Data Source Connection [NEW in v1.1.0]
3-step guided wizard replaces single-step add dialog
Step 1: Source type selection. Step 2: Connection config per type. Step 3: Review + test connection.
POST /datasources/test-connection validates connectivity without persisting credentials

### 8.6 Onboarding Interview [NEW in v1.1.0]
POST /onboarding/interview generates adaptive setup questions based on incomplete city profile fields
Chat-style UI with skip button
Profile updates via PATCH /city-profile
Falls back to default questions when LLM unavailable

## 9. Search & Ingestion [IMPLEMENTED]

### 9.1 Ingestion Pipeline
Two-track model:
Conventional parsers for structured/text-layer files (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, CSV, email, HTML, text)
Multimodal/OCR path for scanned/image-heavy material (Gemma 4 with Tesseract fallback)
[NEW] DOCX/XLSX macro stripping — VBA macros stripped at ZIP level before text extraction. Supports .docm and .xlsm. Stripping logged in metadata for audit.
[NEW] Legacy .xls blocklisted — BIFF8 binary format cannot be macro-stripped with ZIP approach
[NEW] Ingestion retry — POST /datasources/documents/{id}/re-ingest retries failed documents. Progress indicator for processing items, auto-refresh while active.
Sentence-aware text chunking with configurable overlap
Embeddings via nomic-embed-text through Ollama with batch support, stored in pgvector

### 9.2 Hybrid Search
Semantic search via pgvector embeddings
Keyword/full-text search via PostgreSQL tsvector
Combined via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)
Normalized relevance scoring (0–100 scale with visual progress bar)
Source attribution on every result
Optional AI-generated summaries (labeled as AI draft)
[NEW] Department filter — department dropdown filters via document-source-department join chain
[NEW] CSV export — GET /search/export with authenticated download
[NEW] Citation rendering — AI summary panel renders [Doc: filename, Page: N] as styled inline badges

## 10. Exemptions & Compliance

### 10.1 Exemption Rules [IMPLEMENTED]
180 rules across 51 jurisdictions (50 states + DC). Three rule types: regex, keyword, statutory.

### 10.2 Tier 1 PII Detection [IMPLEMENTED]
Built-in patterns: SSN, credit card (Luhn-validated), bank routing/account numbers, phone, email, DOB, state-specific driver's license patterns (CO, CA, TX, NY, FL).

### 10.3 Exemption Review Dashboard [IMPLEMENTED]
Acceptance/rejection rates
Export: /exemptions/dashboard/export?format=json|csv
[NEW] Rule test modal — POST /exemptions/rules/{id}/test tests regex or keyword rules against sample text with match positions. ReDoS protection via regex library with 2-second timeout. LLM-type rules rejected with 400.
[NEW] Audit history — GET /exemptions/rules/{id}/history returns audit log entries. Timeline UI in Exemptions page.

### 10.4 Tiered Redaction Engine [PLANNED]

| Tier | Method | What It Detects | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 | RegEx pattern matching | SSNs, credit cards, phone, email, bank accounts, driver's licenses | [IMPLEMENTED — in exemption engine] |
| Tier 2 | NLP/NER (Ollama or spaCy) | Person names, medical info, juvenile IDs, attorney-client privilege | [PLANNED] |
| Tier 3 | Visual AI (GPU required) | Faces/plates in video, OCR for scanned docs, speech-to-text | [PLANNED] |

### 10.5 Compliance Architecture [IMPLEMENTED]

#### Human-in-the-Loop
No auto-redaction. Every exemption flag requires affirmative human action.
No auto-denial. No auto-release. All AI content labeled at API layer.

#### Audit Logging
Hash-chained (SHA-256), append-only. Every API call logged. CSV/JSON export. Chain verification endpoint.

#### Data Sovereignty
No outbound connections (verification script: scripts/verify-sovereignty.sh)
No telemetry, analytics beacons, or crash reporting. All LLM inference local via Ollama.
All dependencies permissive or weak-copyleft. No AGPL, SSPL, or BSL.

#### Compliance Templates (5 documents) [IMPLEMENTED]
AI governance policy, AI use disclosure, CAIA impact assessment, data residency attestation, response-letter disclosure
Template render endpoint with city profile variable substitution

#### Model Transparency [IMPLEMENTED]
Model registry CRUD in admin router. Context window tracking. Active model selection.

### 11.5 Security for Connectors
Network discovery: disabled by default, explicit IT opt-in, audit-logged.
Every connection: admin must review, confirm, provide credentials, authorize.
Credentials: AES-256 encrypted at rest. Never logged, exported, or displayed after entry.
Test-connection endpoint: dedicated schema, never persists credentials, never logs connection strings.
Least-privilege: read-only accounts. System never writes to source systems.
CJIS Compliance: Architecture satisfies encryption (5.10.1), audit logging (5.4), access control (5.5), no cloud egress (5.10.3.2). City must satisfy fingerprint checks (5.12), signed addendum, and security training (5.2). Compliance gate blocks public safety connector activation until confirmed.

## 12. Security Hardening
Security measures implemented across the stack:
JWT authentication with configurable lifetime, minimum 32-char secret enforced at startup
Login rate limiting in main.py middleware
Role-based access control with 6-role numeric hierarchy
Self-demotion guard — admins cannot change their own role or deactivate their own account
Hash-chained audit log (SHA-256) — tamper-evident, append-only
Prompt injection sanitization in central LLM client
ReDoS protection — regex library with 2s timeout for admin-entered exemption patterns
VBA macro stripping from DOCX/XLSX at ZIP level before ingestion
Legacy .xls blocklisted (BIFF8 cannot be macro-stripped)
Test-connection credential safety — never persists, logs, or returns credentials
API keys hashed (SHA-256) before storage
No telemetry, no outbound connections, no crash reporting
SMTP credentials never logged or displayed after entry
All LLM outputs labeled as AI-generated drafts

## 13. Accessibility
Target: WCAG 2.2 AA. Several requirements now implemented; full audit still pending.

| Requirement | Current State | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Color contrast | Passes (text ~15:1, muted ~5.7:1) | Met |
| Touch targets | 44x44px enforced (min-width + min-height on all interactive elements, all icon button variants) | Met [v1.1.0] |
| Focus visibility | No visible focus styles | Not yet implemented |
| Skip navigation | Skip-to-content link added | Met [v1.0.0] |
| ARIA landmarks | Good (nav role, table aria-labels) | Met |
| Color-only indicators | StatusBadge uses icon+color across all domains | Met [v1.0.0] |
| Keyboard navigation | Untested | Audit pending |
| Form error handling | Not tested | Audit pending |
| Screen reader | Untested | Audit pending |

### 13.1 Content Design Rules
Lead with action: "Tell us what records you need" not "Records Request Submission Form"
Explain why data is requested when not obvious.
Never hide important policy terms only in tooltips.
Every closed/denied request shows reason in human language plus formal basis.
Replace jargon: "responsive documents" → "records found for release"
Every error state explains: what happened, how to fix it, how to get help.
[v1.0.0] Smart empty states provide contextual guidance.

## 17. Next Priorities
Based on the repository as it exists now:
1. Accessibility audit — focus visibility, keyboard navigation, and screen reader testing are the primary open gaps. Touch targets and icon+color badges are done.
2. Liaison scoping completion — role constants and hierarchy are in place; build department-scoped UI views and endpoint restrictions for liaison-level users.
3. Discovery implementation — Discovery.tsx is a shell. Either implement active discovery or mark it explicitly as v1.1+ throughout all documentation.
4. Connector expansion — REST API, ODBC/JDBC, and SharePoint connectors for broader municipal system coverage.
5. Spec alignment — DONE. The in-repo `docs/UNIFIED-SPEC.md` is now this v3.1 document. (Completed alongside the SENT removal and notification_log/exemption_rules drift fixes; see migrations 010 and 011.)
6. Public portal buildout — implement the requester-facing surface only after internal staff workflows are stable and fully documented.
7. CHANGELOG font correction — v1.0.0 CHANGELOG entry says "Inter typography scale" but installed font is Geist Variable. Minor but should be corrected for accuracy.

## 18. Engineering Acceptance Criteria
Every component must support loading, empty, error, and disabled states.
Every workflow must support keyboard-only completion.
Role-based permissions change available actions, not layout or naming.
All status transitions write to audit log automatically.
All status transitions dispatch notifications (if template exists).
Public status pages understandable without staff login.
Onboarding completable by clerk alone without IT involvement.
Network discovery requires explicit IT opt-in.
Every connector authorization is audit-logged.
Health checks surfaced on Dashboard.
Credentials encrypted AES-256 at rest. Never logged, exported, or returned.
Coverage gap map auto-updates.
Zero false negatives for Tier 1 regex PII detection.
All redaction is proposal-only; humans approve.
CJIS compliance gate enforced for public safety connectors.
All LLM calls route through central client with prompt injection sanitization.
ReDoS protection on all admin-entered regex patterns.
VBA macros stripped from all ingested DOCX/XLSX files.

## 19. Canonical Guidance for Future Spec Work
For future documentation, use this precedence order:
1. Repository code and route surface
2. Repository tests
3. CHANGELOG entries
4. Repository README
5. Design/spec prose
When those disagree, do not preserve the older narrative claim just because it sounds cleaner.

## Appendix B: Bottom-Line Summary
CivicRecords AI at v1.1.0 is a substantially complete internal staff platform. In three releases over two days, the codebase grew from an 80-test foundation to a 274-test system with department-level access control, 50-state exemption coverage, a complete notification pipeline, a central LLM client with prompt injection sanitization, fee waiver workflows, a rich text editor, macro stripping, search enhancements, coverage gap monitoring, and user management improvements.
The system is well beyond a simple MVP: it has professional security hardening (ReDoS protection, self-demotion guards, credential safety, macro stripping), operational polish (retry, priority indicators, citation rendering, empty states), and accessibility foundations (44px touch targets, skip navigation, icon+color badges).
What remains: public-facing portal, full active network discovery, expanded connector suite (REST API, ODBC, GIS), liaison-scoped UI completion, Tier 2/3 redaction, and a full accessibility audit (focus styles, keyboard navigation, screen reader testing).
This document (v3.1) is the single source of truth and is now the in-repo `docs/UNIFIED-SPEC.md`.
