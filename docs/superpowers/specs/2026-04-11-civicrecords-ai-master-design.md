# CivicRecords AI — Master Design Specification

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-04-11
**Status:** Approved
**Source Documents:**
- [Product Description](../../product-description.md)
- [Compliance & Regulatory Analysis](../../compliance-regulatory-analysis.md)

---

## 1. Product Summary

CivicRecords AI is a fully open-source, locally-hosted AI system that helps municipal staff respond to open records requests (FOIA/CORA and state equivalents). It runs entirely on commodity hardware — a single Ryzen-based desktop with 32-64 GB of RAM — inside a city's existing network perimeter. No cloud subscriptions. No vendor lock-in. No resident data leaving the building.

The system ingests a city's documents into a searchable knowledge base, then helps staff locate responsive records, flag exemptions, draft response language, and track request status.

### What It Is Not

- Not a records management system — it indexes and searches what already exists.
- Not a legal advisor — it surfaces suggestions, staff make all decisions.
- Not a public-facing portal (v1 is internal staff tool only).
- Not a cloud service — every deployment is a sovereign instance.

### Target Users

- **Primary:** Municipal records staff (clerks, paralegals, records officers). Non-technical. The interface must be as approachable as a search engine.
- **Secondary:** Department heads and city attorneys who review responses before release.
- **Enabling:** City IT staff who install, configure, and maintain the system.

## 2. Competitive Landscape

No existing open-source tool combines AI-assisted search, local-first architecture, municipal workflow management, and state-specific exemption law for the responder side of open records.

| Project | Relevance | Gap |
|---|---|---|
| MITRE FOIA Assistant | Validated exemption detection approach (BERT on deliberative process). Modular exemption framework. Human-in-the-loop. | Federal-only, closed-source, no workflow, single exemption type. |
| OpenFOIA | Local-first, encrypted, entity extraction, relationship graphs. | Requester-side tool (journalists), not responder-side. CLI-only. AGPL. |
| AnythingLLM | MIT-licensed local RAG platform. Workspace isolation, LLM abstraction, Docker deployment. | Generic tool — no FOIA workflow, no exemption detection, no compliance features. |
| RecordTrac (Code for America) | Proven municipal records request workflow used by City of Oakland. Python/Flask. | No AI capabilities whatsoever. |
| GovPilot, OPEXUS | Commercial FOIA management SaaS. | Cloud-based, subscription-priced, vendor lock-in. |

### Architectural Lessons Learned

- **From MITRE:** Treat each exemption category as a separate classification problem, not one monolithic model.
- **From AnythingLLM:** Workspace isolation pattern maps to per-request or per-department document collections. LLM provider abstraction layer enables model swapping without code changes. Collector service pattern for ingestion.
- **From RecordTrac:** Battle-tested municipal workflow patterns for intake, assignment, tracking, and status.

## 3. Architecture Decisions

All decisions documented below were evaluated against the constraint: 1-2 person team building and maintaining the system, deployed on commodity hardware, maintained by municipal IT generalists.

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Backend | Python / FastAPI | AI/ML ecosystem is Python-native. RAG, embeddings, OCR, document parsing — all strongest in Python. |
| LLM Runtime | Ollama | Simple, well-documented, good model library. Model management UX suitable for municipal IT. |
| LLM Model | Gemma 4 (recommended default) | Apache 2.0. 26B MoE (~4B active params) runs on target hardware. Native multimodal (OCR, document parsing). 256K context. Architecture is model-agnostic — works with any Ollama-compatible model. |
| Embedding Model | nomic-embed-text via Ollama | Apache 2.0. Runs natively in Ollama (one less dependency). Swappable via admin panel. |
| Database | PostgreSQL 17 + pgvector | Single database for everything: app data, vector embeddings, audit logs, user accounts. One backup, one restore, one connection pool. Eliminates separate vector DB dependency. |
| Frontend | React + shadcn/ui + Tailwind | 50+ pre-built components. Admin dashboard templates exist. Professional UX out of the box. ~70-80% of needed UI available as copy-paste components. |
| Auth | Built-in (fastapi-users + JWT + RBAC in Postgres) | No separate auth service. Covers 4 roles (Admin, Staff, Reviewer, Read-Only) + service accounts for federation. LDAP/AD can be added as a connector. |
| Task Queue | Celery + Redis | Async ingestion, embedding, and LLM jobs. Well-proven Python ecosystem. |
| Outbound/Federation | Federation-ready REST API (no proxy server) | API designed from day one to support external callers. Service accounts for instance-to-instance auth. No Squid/mitmproxy dependency. |
| Document Storage | Hybrid | Index (extracted text + embeddings) always stored. Original document cached only when attached to an active records request (legal defensibility). |
| Exemption Detection | Rules-primary, LLM-secondary | Deterministic pattern matching (PII regex, statutory phrases) as primary layer. LLM as secondary "did I miss anything?" suggestion layer. All flags require human confirmation. |
| Ingestion | Two-track pipeline | Fast track: lightweight Python parsers for structured docs (DOCX, CSV, email, text). LLM track: Gemma 4 multimodal for scanned PDFs, images, handwriting. Tesseract fallback for non-multimodal models. |
| Licensing | Apache 2.0 (project) | All dependencies must be permissive (MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD) or weak-copyleft (LGPL, MPL, EPL). No AGPL, SSPL, or BSL dependencies. |
| Multi-tenancy | Flat city-wide knowledge base (Phase 1) | Department-level access controls deferred to Phase 2. Single knowledge base is simpler and sufficient for MVP. |
| Deployment | Docker Compose on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS | 5 services: postgres, redis, api, worker, ollama. Frontend served by API or nginx. |

## 4. System Architecture

### Docker Compose Stack

```
Services:
  1. postgres    — PostgreSQL 17 + pgvector (data, vectors, audit)
  2. redis       — Task queue broker
  3. api         — FastAPI application server
  4. worker      — Celery worker(s) for async ingestion/embedding
  5. ollama      — Local LLM runtime (Gemma 4 + nomic-embed-text)
  +  frontend    — React build served by api (or nginx in production)
```

### Application Layer (FastAPI)

The API server contains these modules:

- **Auth Module** — fastapi-users, JWT tokens, 4 roles (Admin, Staff, Reviewer, Read-Only), service accounts for federation.
- **Search API** — RAG queries, hybrid retrieval (semantic + keyword), source attribution, session context for iterative refinement.
- **Workflow API** — Request CRUD, status transitions, document association, deadline management.
- **Audit Logger** — Middleware that logs every API call. Hash-chained, append-only. Exportable as CSV/JSON.
- **LLM Abstraction** — Model-agnostic interface wrapping Ollama. Swap models without touching application code. Supports both chat completion and embedding endpoints.
- **Exemption Engine** — Rules engine (regex, keyword, statutory phrases) + LLM suggestion layer. Each exemption category is a separate detector.
- **Federation API** — REST endpoints accessible via service account API keys. Another CivicRecords AI instance can query this one with scoped access.

### Ingestion Pipeline (Two-Track)

**Fast Track (structured documents):**
- python-docx (MIT) for DOCX
- openpyxl (MIT) for XLSX
- pdfplumber (MIT) for text-layer PDFs
- email/mailbox (stdlib) for EML/MBOX
- csv (stdlib) for CSV
- beautifulsoup4 (MIT) for HTML
- Flow: parse → extract text → chunk → embed via nomic-embed-text → store in pgvector

**LLM Track (scanned/image documents):**
- Scanned PDFs (image-only), JPEG, PNG, TIFF, handwritten documents, charts
- Flow: image → Gemma 4 multimodal → extracted text → chunk → embed → pgvector
- Fallback: Tesseract OCR if running a non-multimodal model

**Ingestion behavior:**
- Incremental: new/modified documents indexed on configurable schedule
- Auditable: every ingested document logged with source, timestamp, hash, status
- Non-destructive: system never modifies source documents
- Chunking configurable per source type

### Data Sources (Phase 1 vs Phase 3)

**Phase 1 (MVP):** Uploaded files, configured file directories
**Phase 3:** SQL databases, IMAP email, SMB/NFS file shares, SharePoint, REST APIs

## 6. Compliance Architecture

Based on the 50-state regulatory analysis, these features are hard requirements enforced at the API layer.

### 6.1 Human-in-the-Loop (Architectural Enforcement)

- No API endpoint produces a final, releasable document without a human approval step.
- Exemption flags stored as recommendations with status (flagged/reviewed/accepted/rejected) — system cannot proceed past "flagged" without human action.
- Response letters generated as drafts in a review queue. "Send" or "finalize" requires authenticated human authorization.
- No "batch approve" or "auto-process" mode for exemption decisions or response generation.

### 6.2 Audit Logging

- Every search query, AI-generated result, exemption flag, draft response, and user action logged with timestamp, user identity, and session context.
- Append-only, hash-chained (each entry includes hash of previous entry).
- Exportable as CSV and JSON for production in response to records requests or attorney general inquiries.
- Retention period configurable per city (default: 3 years, aligns with CAIA).
- Logs distinguish between AI-generated content and human-authored content.

### 6.3 AI Content Labeling

- All LLM outputs visually distinct and labeled as "AI-generated draft requiring human review."
- Labels enforced at the API response layer, not just the UI.

### 6.4 Data Sovereignty

- Installation verification script confirms no outbound network connections (or only allowlisted).
- No telemetry, analytics, or crash reporting that transmits data off the machine.
- Data Residency Attestation document template for city IT directors.
- Verifiable in source code (open source).

### 6.5 Transparency Templates (shipped with product)

- Public AI Use Disclosure statement
- Response Letter Disclosure Language
- CAIA Impact Assessment Template (pre-filled where possible)
- AI Governance Policy Template (based on GovAI Coalition, Boston, San Jose, Bellevue, Garfield County CO)

### 6.6 Exemption Detection Auditability

- Dashboard showing flag acceptance/rejection rates by category, department, and time period.
- Export flag accuracy data for external review.
- Configuration interface for adjusting exemption rules without code changes, with all changes logged.
- Documentation of exemption rule sources with version tracking.

### 6.7 Model Transparency

- Admin panel displays current model name, version, parameter count, license, model card URL.
- No fine-tuning on city data unless explicitly configured by IT. Default: RAG only.
- No proprietary or closed-source models by default.

## 7. Hardware Target

| Component | Minimum Spec | Recommended Spec |
|---|---|---|
| CPU | AMD Ryzen 7 (8-core) | AMD Ryzen 9 (12-16 core) |
| RAM | 32 GB DDR4/DDR5 | 64 GB DDR5 |
| Storage | 1 TB NVMe SSD | 2 TB NVMe SSD |
| GPU | Integrated (CPU inference) | Discrete with 8+ GB VRAM |
| Network | Gigabit Ethernet | Gigabit Ethernet |
| OS | Ubuntu 24.04 LTS | Ubuntu 24.04 LTS |
| Total Cost | ~$800 | ~$1,200 |

**Performance target:** Under 30 seconds for a typical query-and-retrieve cycle on minimum spec without discrete GPU.

---

## 8. Security Model

### Network

- Binds to localhost or city-designated internal IP only. Never exposed to public internet.
- HTTPS with self-signed or city-provided TLS certificates.
- All outbound traffic disabled by default.

### Application

- Role-based access control: Admin, Staff, Reviewer, Read-Only.
- Service accounts with API keys for federation.
- Session management with configurable timeout.
- No default passwords. First-run setup requires creating admin account.
- All API endpoints require authentication.

### Data

- Filesystem-level encryption (LUKS, configured at OS level by IT).
- No plaintext credential storage — secrets via environment variables or local vault.
- Audit logs append-only and tamper-evident (hash-chained).

### AI Safety

- All LLM outputs labeled as AI-generated drafts.
- Prompt injection defense layer sanitizes document content before LLM context.
- Model outputs constrained to retrieval context — cite sources, don't hallucinate.
- Configurable confidence threshold for surfacing low-confidence results.

## 9. Project Decomposition

The system is decomposed into 5 sub-projects built in hybrid sequence:

```
Sub-Project 1: Foundation
    ↓
Sub-Project 2: Ingestion Pipeline
    ↓
Sub-Project 3: RAG Search Engine + UI
    ↓
Sub-Project 3+4: Request Tracking (integrated with Search)
    ↓
Sub-Project 5: Exemption Detection & Compliance
```

### Sub-Project 1: Foundation

**Scope:** Docker Compose stack (Postgres+pgvector, Redis, FastAPI skeleton, Celery, Ollama). User auth (fastapi-users, JWT, 4 roles, service accounts). Hash-chained audit logging middleware. Database migrations (Alembic). Admin panel skeleton (user management, model info). Install script for Ubuntu 24.04. Data sovereignty verification script.

**Exit Criteria:** `docker compose up` starts all services. Admin can create users. Audit log records every action. Verification script confirms no outbound connections.

### Sub-Project 2: Ingestion Pipeline

**Scope:** Data source configuration UI. Fast track parsers (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, CSV, email, HTML, text). LLM track (Gemma 4 multimodal for scans/images, Tesseract fallback). Chunking engine (configurable per source type). Embedding via nomic-embed-text. Celery workers for async processing. Incremental ingestion. Ingestion dashboard.

**Exit Criteria:** Admin connects a file directory, system ingests and indexes documents automatically. Dashboard shows processing status. All ingestion actions audit-logged.

### Sub-Project 3: RAG Search Engine + UI

**Scope:** Natural language search interface (React + shadcn/ui). Hybrid search (pgvector semantic + keyword). Source attribution with document/page references and confidence scores. Filters (date, department, type, source). Iterative refinement (follow-up questions). AI output labeling.

**Exit Criteria:** Records clerk can search ingested documents from their browser, get cited results with confidence scores, refine searches. This is a usable product — the Phase 1 MVP.

### Sub-Project 4: Request Tracking

**Scope:** Request intake form. Associate search results to requests. Status workflow (received → searching → in_review → drafted → approved → sent). Document caching on attachment. Deadline dashboard with alerts. Response letter generation from templates. Review/approval workflow. Compliance disclosure templates.

**Exit Criteria:** Clerk can log a request, search, attach documents, flag for review, generate response letter, get supervisor approval, close the case — entirely within the system.

### Sub-Project 5: Exemption Detection & Compliance

**Scope:** Rules engine (PII regex, statutory keyword patterns). LLM suggestion layer (secondary pass). Per-state exemption rule configuration (framework + pilot states). Exemption flag workflow. Auditability dashboard. CAIA impact assessment template. AI governance policy template.

**Exit Criteria:** Staff see exemption flags on retrieved documents, can review/accept/reject each flag, all decisions audit-logged, compliance templates ready for city attorney review.

---

## 10. Federation (Phase 3+)

The API is designed from day one to support federation between CivicRecords AI instances across jurisdictions.

### Federation Model

- Each instance can act as both client (querying other instances) and server (responding to queries).
- Trust relationships: City A authorizes County B's instance as a trusted peer with scoped access via service accounts.
- Cross-boundary audit trail: "County requested these records from us on [date], authorized by [person]."
- Allowlist/approval model applied to instance-to-instance traffic.

### Day-One API Decisions That Enable Federation

- REST API with proper auth (JWT for humans, API keys for service accounts).
- Service accounts have role-based scoping (what data they can access).
- All API responses include provenance metadata (which instance produced the result).
- No dependency on shared state between instances.

### Deferred to Phase 3

- Instance discovery and registration.
- Cross-instance search (query multiple instances from one UI).
- Federated audit log aggregation.
- Trust relationship management UI.

---

## 13. Gemma 4 Assessment

Gemma 4 (released April 2, 2026) is the recommended default model. Key findings from evaluation:

### Strengths

- Apache 2.0 license — no friction for municipal deployment.
- 26B MoE variant (~4B active parameters) runs on target hardware.
- Native multimodal: OCR, document parsing, handwriting recognition, chart comprehension.
- 256K token context window.
- Strong general reasoning (85% MMLU Pro, 84% GPQA Diamond).

### Limitations

- No published LegalBench scores. Legal reasoning capability is extrapolated from general benchmarks.
- No production deployments for FOIA/legal sensitivity review documented.
- Google's own model card states it is not suitable for autonomous legal decision-making.
- 26B MoE has 22-point gap vs 31B dense on long-context retrieval (44% vs 66%).
- Known failure modes: hallucination, multi-step reasoning degradation, legal terms of art.

### Architecture Implications

- Gemma 4's multimodal capabilities simplify the ingestion pipeline (two-track instead of 5-tool OCR stack).
- LLM is used for search/retrieval and draft generation (strong use case) but NOT as the primary exemption detection engine (unproven use case).
- Exemption detection uses rules-primary approach with LLM as secondary suggestion layer.
- Architecture is model-agnostic. Gemma 4 is recommended, not required.
