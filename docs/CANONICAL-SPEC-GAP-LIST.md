- **What's missing** (specific deliverable gap)

Items completed during the current session are noted but NOT re-listed unless they have remaining sub-gaps.

## Summary Counts

| Phase | Total Items | Complete | Partial | Not Started |
|-------|------------|----------|---------|-------------|
| Phase 0 | 5 | 5 | 0 | 0 |
| Phase 1 (UI pages) | 11 pages | 0 verified | 11 need verification | 0 (all pages exist as files) |
| Phase 2 (Backend) | ~20 items | 12 | 5 | 3 |
| Phase 3 (v1.1) | 18 | 0 | 0 | 18 |
| Phase 4 (v2.0) | 13 | 0 | 0 | 13 |
| WCAG | 9 requirements | 1 | 2 | 6 |

### Critical Path for v1.0 Release

The following Phase 2 items are **blocking** and must be completed before the staff workbench is functional end-to-end:

1. **Context Manager** (Section 4) -- all LLM features depend on this
2. **Response letter generation** (Section 8.3) -- core workflow feature
3. **Onboarding service LLM logic** (Section 12.2) -- first-run experience
4. **Tier 1 regex verification/expansion** (Section 12.7.1) -- compliance requirement
5. **Fee tracking API router** (Section 5) -- needed for request detail page
6. **Skip-to-content link** (Section 9) -- WCAG 2.2 AA hard requirement

Phase 1 pages all exist as files but need **visual verification** against the spec wireframes to confirm they match the redesign requirements. This verification should be done with a running frontend.
