# CivicRecords AI — Development Standards

## Project

Open-source, locally-hosted AI system for municipal open records request processing.
Apache 2.0 licensed. Python/FastAPI backend, React/shadcn/ui frontend, PostgreSQL+pgvector, Ollama.

## Testing Requirements

Every sub-project must pass ALL verification gates before merge:

### Unit Tests
- Run with `cd backend && python -m pytest tests/ -v` (no Docker required for pure unit tests)
- Parser, chunker, embedder tests must pass without a database
- Integration tests (auth, audit, admin, datasources, documents) require PostgreSQL

### Integration Tests
- Require Docker: `docker compose up -d postgres redis`
- Create test database: `docker compose exec postgres createdb -U civicrecords civicrecords_test`
- Run: `DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://civicrecords:civicrecords@localhost:5432/civicrecords_test python -m pytest tests/ -v`

### Docker Verification
- `docker compose build` must succeed with no errors
- `docker compose up -d` must start all services healthy
- `curl http://localhost:8000/health` must return `{"status": "ok"}`
- `curl http://localhost:8000/docs` must serve OpenAPI docs

### Frontend Verification
- `cd frontend && npm install && npm run build` must succeed
- No TypeScript errors
- Login page renders, dashboard loads, navigation works

### QA Checklist (before merge)
- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] All integration tests pass
- [ ] Docker Compose starts all services
- [ ] API health endpoint responds
- [ ] Frontend builds without errors
- [ ] Spec/docs match implemented code (feature counts, endpoint names, etc.)
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials in code
- [ ] Audit logging verified (actions create log entries)

## Post-Push Verification

After every `git push`, verify the remote state matches what you expect — not the git output, the actual result:
- `git log origin/master --oneline -3` to confirm commits landed
- `git diff HEAD origin/master` to confirm nothing diverged
- If a specific file matters, verify it exists on remote

Same principle applies to all deployment actions: verify the outcome, not the action. Seed scripts must be run against the production database and verified in the running UI. Connectors must be wired into the pipeline with integration tests. Code that exists but has no caller is not shipped.

## Code Standards

- Python: Follow existing patterns. Use async/await consistently. Type hints on all public functions.
- TypeScript: Strict mode. No `any` types except in catch blocks.
- Tests: Unit tests for pure logic, integration tests for API endpoints, mocked external services (Ollama).
- Commits: Conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`).

## Architecture

See `docs/UNIFIED-SPEC.md` for the canonical spec (single source of truth).

### Key Constraints
- All dependencies must be permissive or weak-copyleft licensed (MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD, LGPL, MPL)
- Redis pinned to <8.0.0 (BSD licensed; 8.x changed licensing)
- No telemetry, analytics, or outbound data transmission
- Human-in-the-loop enforced at API layer (no auto-redaction, no auto-denial)
- Audit logging is a legal compliance requirement, not optional

## Docker Services

4. `api` — FastAPI backend (port 8000)
5. `worker` — Celery async tasks
6. `beat` — Celery beat scheduler
7. `frontend` — React admin panel (port 8080)
