"""Add liaison and public values to user_role enum

Revision ID: 012_liaison_public_roles
Revises: 011_fix_drift
Create Date: 2026-04-14

The UserRole Python enum has always declared LIAISON and PUBLIC, but the
Postgres user_role type was created in migration 001 with only four values:
admin, staff, reviewer, read_only.  Any attempt to INSERT a user with role
'liaison' or 'public' via the live database raises:

    invalid input value for enum user_role: "liaison"

This migration adds the two missing values.  ALTER TYPE … ADD VALUE is
transactional in Postgres 12+ only when not inside an explicit transaction;
Alembic executes DDL inside a transaction by default, so we must use
execute_if / non-transactional DDL or simply add the values unconditionally
with IF NOT EXISTS (Postgres 9.6+).
