"""Regression: Celery prefork + asyncio event-loop reuse in task_ingest_file.

The bug
-------
`backend/app/ingestion/tasks.py` (v1.6.0) constructs a module-global async
engine inside the ``worker_process_init`` Celery signal. That hook fires
once per forked worker process, *before* any event loop exists. asyncpg's
``Connection`` objects bind their internal ``_loop`` / ``_waiter`` machinery
to **whichever loop first awaited I/O on them** — i.e. the loop owned by
the first Celery task. ``_run_async`` then closes that loop. Every later
task on the same prefork worker tries to schedule asyncpg callbacks on
the closed loop and raises one of:

  RuntimeError: Event loop is closed
  RuntimeError: ... got Future <...> attached to a different loop

The first task on a fresh worker succeeds; the second always retries until
``max_retries=2`` is exhausted and the document is left at chunk_count=0.

Why this test does not need a real Postgres
-------------------------------------------
The defect is purely about asyncio event-loop identity, not about SQL.
A self-contained ``_FakeAsyncEngine`` reproduces asyncpg's loop-binding
contract exactly: each engine records the loop that first opened a
session, and any later session opened on a different loop raises the
same ``RuntimeError: Event loop is closed`` asyncpg raises. With the
current buggy ``tasks.py`` (engine built once in ``worker_process_init``
+ ``_run_async`` builds a fresh loop per task) this test fails on the
second ``task_ingest_file.apply()`` call. With the fix (engine built
inside the per-task coroutine and disposed before the loop closes) the
test passes both calls.

This matches the test design in
``.agent-runs/2026-05-14-celery-asyncio-worker-fix/research.md``:
two sequential ``task_ingest_file`` invocations in the same Python
process, asserting neither raises the two diagnostic RuntimeErrors.
